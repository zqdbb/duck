//! `tofd` — owns the head ToF sensor, publishes its frames, and nothing else.
//!
//! ## Why this is its own daemon
//!
//! `architecture.md` §1 splits perception from `robotd` deliberately: a
//! perception crash must not take out motor control. This sensor makes the case
//! concretely — bringing it up uploads ~90 KB of firmware over I²C, taking
//! seconds; it shares a bus with the audio codec; and a sensor that is not fitted
//! (the common case on a duck without the head module) must be a daemon logging
//! one line, not a retry loop inside the control loop's process. Nothing in the
//! 50 Hz loop reads depth, so nothing is gained by putting it there.
//!
//! One writer owns the sensor (invariant 4), so every consumer — `robotctl
//! monitor` today, mapping and obstacle avoidance when the kinematics arrive —
//! reads the same frames from one place instead of contending for the bus.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! A blocking thread drives the sensor: open, probe, upload firmware, then poll
//! for frames and broadcast them. The socket server is async and reads no
//! hardware; a subscriber that stops reading is dropped rather than allowed to
//! slow the sensor (`broadcast` gives that for free, and a lagging consumer's gap
//! is visible in [`proto::TofFrame::seq`]).
//!
//! No frame is *stored*: this is a stream. A consumer that arrives mid-scan waits
//! for the next frame, which at 15 Hz is 66 ms away.
