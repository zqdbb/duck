//! Mint releases that carry systemd units and a real `updaterd`, for the one harness that needs
//! real systemd: `scripts/systemd-test.sh`.
//!
//! Its sibling `fake-release` deliberately mints releases with **no units** and a config whose
//! `on_apply` is `none`, because it exists to drive the engine's own logic where systemd is not
//! present. That is the right fixture for almost everything and the wrong one for exactly one
//! question: *does the restart machinery work?* Answering that needs units that really start, a
//! transient timer that really fires, and an `updaterd` that is really replaced by its successor —
//! so it needs its own fixture rather than a flag on that one.
//!
//! What each release carries:
//!
//! ```text
//!   bin/updaterd  bin/robotctl        the binaries under test, built for the container
//!   systemd/updaterd.service          so the update can restart the updater — the whole point
//!   systemd/fake-robotd.service       a stand-in for a daemon in the restart set
//!   systemd/btd.service               a stand-in for the one daemon held back from that restart
//!   bin/fake-btd                      what it runs: publishes an identity, then sleeps
//!   systemd/recovery-check.service    a oneshot with no `[Install]`, which nothing may restart
//!   systemd/broken.service            only in `:broken-unit`: ExecStart=/bin/false
//!   systemd/needs-a-user.service      only in `:sysusers` and `:missing-user`, with `User=`
//!   systemd/sysusers.d/duck-test.conf only in `:sysusers`, and what creates that user
//!   hooks/postinstall                 the real one, so it installs and enables units for real
//! ```
//!
//! `fake-robotd` rather than a real `robotd`: what is under test is whether the engine restarts what
//! a release ships, and a `sleep` proves that as well as motor control does while needing no
//! hardware, no policy and no socket. Its main PID changing is the observation.
//!
//! **The stand-in named `btd` is named that on purpose.** `NEVER_RESTART` is a list of unit names in
//! code, so only a unit actually called `btd` is excluded from the in-flight restart and picked up by
//! the deferred one — which makes it the only way to observe the case the startup reconciliation
//! exists for: a deferred restart that never happened. Unlike `fake-robotd` it publishes an identity,
//! because that is what the reconciliation reads.
