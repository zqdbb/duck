//! The radio. BlueZ via `bluetoothd`'s D-Bus API, Linux only.
//!
//! Everything here is plumbing between BlueZ and [`crate::session`]'s two channels. No decision
//! about the robot is taken in this file, which is the point: the logic that could be wrong is
//! the logic that is tested, and this is the part that needs a radio.
//!
//! It uses `bluer`'s **callback model**, and the alternative was tried on hardware and does not
//! work. `bluer`'s IO model answers BlueZ's `WriteValue` and `StartNotify` with `NotSupported` —
//! it serves only the `AcquireWrite`/`AcquireNotify` fd paths — and a CoreBluetooth central drove
//! the ordinary methods. The result was a robot that advertised, accepted a connection, accepted a
//! subscription, accepted a write, and delivered none of it to this file: no `central connected`
//! line, no pairing prompt, and a client timing out against a service that was working.
//!
//! The IO model was chosen for a benefit that turns out not to exist. It reports
//! `device_address()` on both halves, which looked necessary for pairing a subscription to the
//! session that should feed it — but `bluer` holds **one** `CharacteristicNotifyState` per
//! characteristic, so there is only ever one notification session to pair with. One central at a
//! time is a property of the stack, not a shortcut taken here.
//!
//! So: one session for the service's lifetime, one notify pump, and a write callback that pushes
//! bytes into it.
//!
//! **What the callback model costs is flow control**, and that bill came due the first time a
//! reply was more than a few kilobytes. `notify` hands a D-Bus signal to the connection and
//! returns; nothing here can ask BlueZ whether the radio has caught up, and nothing reports the
//! notification MTU either. Both gaps are worked around rather than solved: the payload is taken
//! from what BlueZ reports on inbound writes (one ATT MTU serves both directions, capped at the
//! 512-byte limit on a characteristic value — see `framing::notification_payload`), and the pump
//! pauses every [`NOTIFY_BURST`] chunks. The IO model has the readiness signal this wants and
//! still cannot be used, for the reason above — it serves only the `Acquire*` paths.

/// The handle deregisters on drop, so the caller holds it for as long as the robot should be

///
/// **Both names, because a robot has two and only one of them used to be set.** The advertisement
/// carries a Local Name; the adapter separately serves a GAP Device Name (`0x2A00`), which BlueZ
/// takes from `Adapter.Alias` and which defaults to the hostname. So a renamed robot advertised
/// `duck-5b21` while answering `radxa-zero3` to anyone who read the characteristic — and a client
/// that read it kept the answer:
///
/// - **BlueZ caches it over the advertised name.** `Device1.Name` is what `btleplug` reports, so
///   on Linux a robot is `duck-5b21` until the first connection and `radxa-zero3` after it, and
///   `duckctl --name duck-5b21` then finds nothing. Two scans a minute apart disagreed;
/// - **CoreBluetooth keeps both**, and `btleplug` joins them as `radxa-zero3 [duck-5b21]`;
/// - **a phone's Bluetooth settings shows the GAP name**, which is the case that matters most and
///   the one nothing in this repo could see.
///
/// Setting the alias is therefore part of naming the robot rather than a nicety, and it belongs
/// here so that no path can publish a name without it: [`reconcile_advertisement`] re-advertises on
/// every rename and comes through this function to do it. The alias persists in BlueZ's own state,
/// so the write is skipped when it already says the right thing.
///
/// A failure to set it is logged and not propagated. The alias is worth less than being visible at
/// all, and returning an error here would take the advertisement down with it.
///
/// **The address field is dropped rather than allowed to fail the registration.** The arithmetic in
/// [`duck_ble::adv`] says the payload fits, but the byte that overflows a legacy advertisement is the
/// controller's to count, not ours — and BlueZ refuses the whole registration when it does not fit.
/// On a robot whose only front door may be BLE, that trade is not close: an advertisement with no
/// address is a robot someone can still reach, and a refused one is a robot that has gone dark. Same
/// reasoning as the alias above, one step further down.
