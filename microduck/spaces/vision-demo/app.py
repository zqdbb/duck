"""A duck's camera, processed on Hugging Face hardware — with the robot doing the dialling.

The robot is behind somebody's router and this runs in a container in a data centre. The obvious
way to join them is the one this Space used to take: a WebRTC consumer pulls the stream through
`reachy_mini_central`. That ran into the one thing WebRTC cannot do unaided — a relay candidate —
and the relay default every robot shipped with pointed at a name with no DNS behind it, so
signalling crossed and media never did, from every Space, every time. That default is fixed
(`docs/design/remote-access-design.md` §6) and this design is still the right one: a relay costs
somebody's bandwidth, metered against the robot owner's Hugging Face allowance, for every frame
of a stream only a program is going to look at.

**So the direction is inverted and the problem disappears.** The rendezvous is used for one small
thing — telling the robot where to send frames — and the frames come **outbound from the robot** to
a WebSocket on this Space. A robot dialling out is the one thing that always works; it is doing it
right now to stay reachable at all. NAT stops being a participant, no relay is needed, and the
rendezvous carries an instruction rather than pixels, which is also why this scales where relaying
payload through a shared service would not.

    this Space ──media.stream {url: "wss://…/frames"}──► rendezvous ──► the duck
    the duck   ═════════ JPEG frames, outbound wss, direct ═════════►  this Space

Two consequences worth knowing. There is **no return media path**, so this cannot drive the robot
or speak to it except through the control lane above — which is enough to start and stop a stream
and to ask what the robot is doing. And the frames are **upright already**: `mediad` turns them
while converting, because that conversion is a per-pixel loop either way and what receives them is
a model that wants the picture the way up it was trained on.

#
# A `gr.LoginButton` sets `blocks.expects_oauth`, which makes Gradio call `attach_oauth` while the
# Blocks is being *built* — at import, before anything serves. That then does one of two things,
# and both raise in a container:
#
# - `SPACE_ID` absent → the *mocked* routes, whose `_get_mocked_oauth_info()` needs a local
#   `hf auth login`. A container has none: `ValueError: Your machine must be logged in to HF`.
# - `SPACE_ID` present but `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` absent → the real routes, which raise
#   `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID environment variable is not set`.
#
# Either way uvicorn never binds, and Hugging Face reports an exiting container as "App process
# crashed" — with the UI apparently visible for a second, because the *previous* container was
# still serving it. That cost four rounds of blaming the port.
#
# The condition is therefore the variable Gradio actually needs, read from inside the container
# (`/env` on the hello Space is how this was established rather than guessed): OAuth is available
# when the platform provisioned it, which needs `hf_oauth: true` in the README *and* a Space that
# has rebuilt since. When it has not, a token box takes the button's place and the page still
# works — which is the property worth having, because this is exactly the state a freshly
