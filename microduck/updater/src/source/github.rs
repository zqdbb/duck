//! GitHub Releases source — the daemon channel.
//!
//! "Latest" is resolved by listing releases and taking the highest **semver** among
//! tags matching `tag_prefix`, not by using `/releases/latest`: that endpoint is
//! repo-wide, so it breaks the moment a second channel shares the repo, and it
//! answers "most recently published" rather than "highest version" — which differ as
//! soon as you publish a patch to an older line.
//! See `docs/design/updater-design.md` §6.
//!
//! Nothing here is trusted. Tags, release names and asset URLs are all attacker- or
//! mistake-influenced; the only thing that makes an artifact acceptable is the
//! minisign signature the caller checks afterwards.
