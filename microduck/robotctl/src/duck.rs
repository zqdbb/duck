//! The monitor's live 3D view of the robot.
//!
//! A joints table says *how far* each servo is from its target; it cannot say what the
//! robot looks like. A leg folded the wrong way, a head pitched into the ground and a
//! robot lying on its side are all just numbers there, and every one of them is obvious
//! the moment the pose is drawn. This module draws it: the same visual model the policies
//! were trained against, posed by the measured joint angles on the wire and tilted by the
//! IMU's projected gravity, rendered into terminal cells.
//!
//! The geometry is baked by `scripts/bake-duck-mesh.py` from the app repository's MJCF
//! and compiled in — `robotctl` stays a single binary with no assets directory, and the
//! board never parses CAD. The bake decimates ~330k CAD triangles to the few thousand a
//! terminal can even express; the renderer here is a plain z-buffered rasterizer over
//! them, orthographic, flat-shaded, drawing two pixels per cell with the half-block
//! glyph so pixels come out square. No GPU, no dependency — a frame is a few
//! milliseconds of arithmetic on the board's own CPU.
