#
# Radxa Zero 3W on the Armbian vendor kernel. Needs the camera overlay active — the ISP
# parameter and statistics nodes only exist there, and the engine has nothing to talk to
# without them.
#
# ── Why a vendor engine at all ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# There is no other 3A on this platform. libcamera's rkisp1 IPA drives the *mainline* rkisp1
# driver; this board runs Rockchip's vendor rkisp on the vendor kernel, which is also where the
# hardware encoder `mediad` depends on lives (`docs/project/media-bringup.md`). Choosing
# mainline to get an open 3A would cost the VPU, so the vendor engine — a prebuilt deb from
# Radxa's pool, taken as a direct download the way the MPP packages are — is the route.
#
# ── What differs from the prototype's version of this script ──────────────────
#
# **rkaiq's auto exposure is turned off here, as the prototype turned it off — because it fires
# once and `mediad` needs it to keep firing.** This script first shipped with AE left enabled, on
# the reasoning that the prototype only disabled it to stop the engine fighting a runtime that
# owned exposure itself, and that nothing owned exposure here. Measured on a robot: the engine's
# AE does write the sensor, once, at stream start — `mediad` pinned `exposure=600
# analogue_gain=1024` and the sensor was found at `1589 / 1536`, which is the engine's answer and
# not ours. But a hand-written `exposure=300 analogue_gain=256` on that same healthy boot held for
# 25 seconds with no correction. One convergence is not auto-exposure, and a robot that walks from
# a window into a corridor keeps the window's exposure.
#
# So `mediad::exposure` meters the frames and drives the sensor (the prototype's loop, ported),
# and this leaves the engine the parts it does continuously: white balance, the colour matrix,
# gamma and noise reduction. Its one-shot is disabled rather than tolerated because it lands at
# stream start, which is exactly when mediad's loop is converging from its own starting values —
# two writers, in a race, for one control.
