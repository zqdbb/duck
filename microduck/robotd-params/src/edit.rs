//! Editing `robotd.toml` without disturbing it.
//!
//! The lossless writer for this crate's own schema: parse with `toml_edit`, set or remove exactly
//! the keys asked for, re-parse the candidate through [`Params::load`] before anything reaches the
//! disk, and write atomically. Comments, ordering and keys from releases this build does not know
//! all survive.
//!
//! ## Why it is here rather than in `robotctl`
//!
//! It began as part of `robotctl configure`, which was the only thing that wrote this file. Then
//! two more callers appeared: `robotctl policy` and `robotctl pad` write keys of their own, and a
//! daemon serving `pad.bind` over the radio has to write the same file — `padd` re-reads `[pad]`
//! every second, so a binding that only changed something in memory would be reverted before
//! anybody let go of the phone.
//!
//! A second implementation would drift from this one, and the thing it would drift on is the
//! validation: the guarantee worth keeping is that **nothing writes a file `robotd` would refuse
//! to start on**, and that guarantee is only as good as its least careful writer. So the writer
//! lives beside the schema it enforces, in the crate that defines it.
//!
//! `toml_edit` is pure Rust, so this crate's rule that nothing here grows a C toolchain or a
//! network stack still holds — which matters, because this is the crate on the recovery path.
//!
//! ## What is not here
//!
//! Which systemd unit a change needs restarted, how to restart it, and how any of this is
//! presented. Those are a host's business and an operator tool's business, and they stay in
//! `robotctl`.
