//! The observation vector the policy sees.
//!
//! **This is the highest-risk code in the crate.** It is a flat array of 61 floats whose
//! every index must match what the policy was trained against. A wrong offset does not fail
//! loudly — it produces a plausible-looking robot that falls over, and the symptom looks
//! like a tuning or timing problem rather than an indexing one.
//!
//! Every alpha policy is `obs[1,61] → actions[1,14]`, verified across walking, standing,
//! ground pick, ball kick and sit. So there is exactly one layout, not the five the
//! prototype carried (51/54-D legacy, 49-D wheeled, 85-D tracking are all v1/v1.5 history).
//!
//! ```text
//! index   width  contents
//! 0..3        3  gyro, trunk frame, rad/s
//! 3..6        3  projected gravity, trunk frame, unit vector
//! 6..20      14  joint position minus home pose, mouth excluded
//! 20..34     14  joint velocity, mouth excluded
//! 34..48     14  previous action, mouth excluded
//! 48..61     13  command (below)
//! ```
//!
//! The command block, which is the part with no second source of truth:
//!
//! ```text
//! 48..51      3  vx, vy, vyaw
//! 51..55      4  neck_pitch, head_pitch, head_yaw, head_roll
//! 55..57      2  body x, y      — always zero, unbound in training
//! 57          1  body z
//! 58          1  body roll
//! 59          1  body pitch
//! 60          1  body yaw       — always zero, unbound in training
//! ```
//!
//! Two things about that block are easy to get wrong and were confirmed against
//! `microduck_runtime`'s `control_step` rather than assumed:
//!
//!  1. **Body x, y and yaw are hardcoded zero.** They are unbound in the training
//!     environment, so an all-zero body command is the *nominal* encoding, not a
//!     placeholder standing in for something better.
//!  2. **Head targets ride in the command, and are not added on top of the policy output.**
//!     The prototype does both, in different modes, and gates the post-hoc addition behind
//!     `if !new_cmd_obs` with the note "head_offsets are a COMMAND fed via the obs vector
//!     instead — don't double-add it here". Doing both would bend the head twice.
//!
//! Note also the order inside the body block: `z, roll, pitch`, not `z, pitch, roll`.
