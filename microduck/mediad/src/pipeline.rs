//! The GStreamer pipeline, and the datachannel the control channel rides on.
//!
//! Linux only, the way `padd`'s evdev tap is: the daemon runs on the robot, and everything else in
//! this crate — [`crate::route`], [`crate::session`], [`crate::upstream`] — is portable and stays
//! testable on a laptop. Gating here rather than behind a feature keeps `cargo test` honest on both.

//!                                       (leaky)     │
//!                                          │        └─ consumer-added → "control" channel
//!                                      appsink
//!                                   a frame on request
//! ```
//!
//! **The tee is on raw NV12, before the encoder**, and that placement is the point of it.
//! `architecture.md` §5.3 wants a frame on demand for a server-side program — "it wants a frame
//! every second or two plus a state blob", not a 30 fps H.264 track to decode — and §2 wants
//! perception next to the sensor, deriving features rather than shipping pixels to `robotd`. Both
//! need pixels, and taking them off the encoded branch would mean decoding what we just encoded.
//!
//! NV12 because that is what the rkisp capture path emits and what `mpph264enc` takes, so nothing
//! *converts* anywhere: no `videoconvert`, and no RGA pass, between capture and either consumer.
//!
//! **Nothing converts and nothing rotates.** The head camera is mounted a quarter turn off, and for
//! one afternoon this pipeline fixed that with a `videoflip` before the tee — which broke
//! `mpph264enc`'s zero-copy path to the 2D engine and had MPP converting every frame in software:
//! 97 °C, the CPU throttled to 408 MHz, 8 fps out of a 30 fps camera. Rotation is now the
//! consumer's business, because for both consumers it is free — a CSS transform in the browser, and
//! a resample the detector was doing anyway. [`Rotation`] has the numbers.
//!
//! **Each branch has its own `queue`, and the raw one is leaky.** A `tee` without queues runs its
//! branches on one thread, so a slow consumer stalls the others — here that would mean a
//! perception consumer pausing the video track. The raw branch drops old frames rather than
//! applying backpressure, which is the semantics `architecture.md` §2 asks for: the *latest*
//! snapshot, never a queue of stale ones. A stalled reader costs frames, never the encoder.
//!
//! **And the raw branch only copies a frame somebody asked for.** Every buffer reaches the appsink
//! and nearly all of them are dropped there unread — see [`crate::pipeline::Frames`] for what that saves and why the
//! request has to be answered by the *next* capture rather than the last one.
//!
//! **`webrtcsink` runs the signalling server in this process** (`run-signalling-server`, with
//! `signalling-server-host` and `-port`), so the separate `gst-webrtc-signalling-server` binary
//! never has to be built or shipped — what we ship from that upstream is a `.so`.
//! `remote-webrtc.md` §3.
//!
//! **`webrtcsink` owns the encoder, and is handed raw video.** It briefly did not — the pipeline
//! was `mpph264enc ! h264parse ! webrtcsink`, which worked and quietly gave up two things: with
//! pre-encoded input `webrtcsink` cannot reach the encoder, so its congestion control cannot adapt
//! the bitrate to the link, and a peer's PLI cannot produce a keyframe, leaving a viewer that lost
//! one broken until the next periodic GOP.
//!
//! That costs a software `videoconvert ! videoscale` in front of any encoder `webrtcsink` does not
//! recognise, and it does not recognise `mpph264enc` — so **the plugin we ship carries a patch**
//! adding that arm. Without the patch this arrangement is slower than pre-encoding rather than
//! faster; the two belong together. See `patches/` in `pollen-robotics/microduck-gst-plugins`.
//!
//! The encoder settings survive through `encoder-setup` — see [`wire_encoder_setup`], which is
//! also where a fallback to software encoding gets noticed.
//!
//! ## A test pattern before a camera
//!
//! The default source is `videotestsrc`. That is not a placeholder for want of a better idea: it is
//! the source that works on a board with no camera attached, which is most of them, and it makes
//! the whole session — signalling, negotiation, the datachannel, the control API — exercisable
//! without the capture path existing. The camera arrives as a different source element behind the
//! same encoder, and `media-bringup.md` records why capture cannot simply be `v4l2src`.
//!
//! **It runs at `robotd_params::TEST_PATTERN_GEOMETRY` rather than `[media] quality`**, and that is
//! a CPU decision. A camera's frames come off the ISP in hardware; a test pattern's are drawn by
//! this process, so at the configured rung an idle board with no camera burned 29.4% of a core
//! against a real camera's 6.1% — synthesising 1.84 MB of UYVY thirty times a second for a tee
//! whose readers had all said no. The session it exists to provide needs none of those pixels.
//!
//! ## What is not verified
//!
//! **Nothing in a signal handler here may panic.** These closures are invoked from C, so a panic
//! does not unwind — it aborts the process, and the journal shows `thread caused non-unwinding
//! panic` with a backtrace through `g_closure_invoke` and nothing about what was actually wrong.
//! The first board run died exactly that way, from `tokio::spawn` on a GStreamer thread that has
//! no runtime. So: the runtime handle is captured where one exists and spawned onto explicitly,
//! and every signal is checked to exist before it is connected or emitted — `emit_by_name` and
//! `connect` both panic on an absent name.
//!
//! What is left of that risk is a signature that exists but differs, which shows up as a warning
//! naming the arity rather than as an abort.
