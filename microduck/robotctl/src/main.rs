//! `robotctl` — local CLI for the robot.
//!
//! A **thin client over `updaterd`'s unix socket**: parse argv, send one JSON-RPC
//! request, print the streamed notifications and result, map the outcome to an
//! exit code. It contains no update logic — that lives in the engine inside
//! `updaterd`. Same relationship `btd` has to the socket, different transport:
//!
//! ```text
//!   phone ──▶ btd ──────┐
//!                       ├──▶ /run/updaterd.sock ──▶ updaterd
//!   you / CI ─▶ robotctl┘
//! ```
//!
//! Scope: **only the `update` namespace is implemented.** The `robotctl` name is
//! kept for the eventual general-purpose robot CLI, and commands are namespaced
//! from the start so scripts written today keep working when other namespaces are
//! added.
//!
//! Two audiences, and the second dictates the design rules:
//!  - support and field recovery, when the app or BLE isn't an option;
//!  - CI and bench testing, where every operation must be scriptable
//!    (`docs/design/updater-design.md` §16.1).
//!
//! Therefore:
//!  - **No prompts, ever.** Nothing here may ask a question.
//!  - **Idempotent.** Re-running a command that already holds is success, so
//!    scripts needn't branch on current state.
//!  - **Exit codes are meaningful**, so tests assert on them without parsing text.
//!  - **Notifications to stderr, results to stdout**, so `--json` stays pipeable
//!    while progress stays visible.
//!  - Works when `robotd` is dead. It talks to `updaterd`, not to `robotd`.
