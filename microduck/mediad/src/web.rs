//! The page, served by the daemon it drives.
//!
//! An embedded console and an on-demand PNG snapshot, with no frontend build step. `http://<robot>:8080/` and there is nothing else to run —
//! which is the whole of it, and `webrtc-console.md` §1 is why it is worth a dependency and a
//! second port.
//!
//! **It deletes four problems rather than one.** No `python3 -m http.server`, so the instruction is
//! an address rather than two commands. No URL to type, because a page served by the robot knows
//! which robot it came from and derives its signalling target from `location.hostname`. Chrome's
//! Private Network Access check stops applying, because that check is on requests from a *public or
//! opaque* origin to a private address — and a page served from `192.168.x` has a private one, so
//! the failure that made `file://` unusable cannot happen. And page and binary ship together, so a
//! client from a checkout can no longer be pointed at a robot from a release.
//!
//! ## The port and the API version are filled in here, not carried by the page
//!
//! [`page`] substitutes both into the embedded page once, at startup. That is what makes `--port`
//! safe to change: nothing holds a second copy of it. The *host* is the browser's to fill —
//! `location.hostname`, which is the robot that served the page — so this is one number and not a
//! URL.
//!
//! The API version is the same idea applied to the skew banner. A page cannot compare versions
//! without knowing which one it speaks, and a literal in the page would be the second copy of
//! [`proto::API_VERSION`] — wrong on the day it is bumped, and wrong in the direction that reports
//! agreement. Substituted, a page served by a robot is a page that speaks that robot's release, and
//! the banner it shows is about a *checkout* page pointed at a robot, which is the case it exists
//! for.
//!
//! A page opened straight from the source tree keeps the token, reads it as `NaN`, and falls back to
//! `webrtcsink`'s own 8443. It also then knows it was *not* served by a robot, which is what lets it
//! tell "wrong host" apart from "the robot served me but its signalling port did not answer" — the
//! one failure two ports can produce, and §1.3's requirement that it reach a person as a diagnosis.
//!
//! ## Portable, unlike [`crate::pipeline`]
//!
//! Nothing here touches GStreamer, so it compiles and its tests run on a laptop. The substitution is
//! the part worth a test: a page served with the token still in it would connect to the wrong port
//! and say nothing about why.
