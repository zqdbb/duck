//! `robotd` — the robot control daemon.
//!
//! The 50 Hz control loop, the `robot.*` socket, and the health the updater gates on
//! (`docs/design/robotd-design.md` §1.4, §3.4).
//!
//! **Health is why the daemon has the shape it does.** The updater's auto-rollback is only
//! meaningful if `robot.health` means something, and it used to mean "the loop ticked once" —
//! so every rollback was tested against a placeholder. It now means **the loop is meeting its
//! deadline**: a loop running at 60% of target is alive, answers every request, and is badly
//! broken.
//!
//! Holding the pose with no policy (`policy.enabled = false`) stays the right thing to be doing
//! while someone deliberately breaks releases at a bench: the bus sees the real load at the
//! real rate, and nothing falls over when a bad build lands.
//!
//! Every method must be answerable *while the robot is in a bad state*,
//! since that is exactly when it is asked. So the IPC side reads atomics the control loop
//! publishes and never calls into the loop — a wedged loop reports itself unhealthy rather
//! than hanging the caller.
