"""Microduck VelStand environment: walking + protective fall + recovery, one policy.

PROTECTIVE-FALL REBUILD (2026-09, branch protective_fall). Motivation: the real
robots keep breaking XL330 gearboxes. The daemon's fall-detect limp (kp→50)
helped but is imperfect, and the limp→standup hand-off produces "convulsions".
Goal: ONE policy that walks, falls in a way that protects the servos, and gets
up gently — so the daemon limp can eventually be switched off.

What changed vs the 2026-07 design (kept below, still valid):
  - WARM START from the deployed walk (wandb 441tzs6d @ model_3750 — the exact
    checkpoint behind alpha_walking.onnx). Same 61D obs / 512-256-128 actor /
    76D critic, so `--agent.resume True --wandb-run-path ... --wandb-checkpoint-name
    model_3750.pt` loads everything. Consequence: the walk exists at iter 0, so
    every velocity-recipe curriculum (action_rate ramp, standing-env fraction,
    head/body command ranges, CoM DR, head_pose_bias weight) is COLLAPSED to
    its final stage (WARM_START) — re-running them from stage 0 would re-teach
    the walk under easier conditions and drift it. Only velstand's own phases
    ramp, and they are ~2× shorter than the from-scratch schedule.
    LAUNCH:  MICRODUCK_WARM_START=1 uv run train Mjlab-VelStand-Flat-MicroDuck \
               --env.scene.num-envs 4096 --agent.resume True \
               --wandb-run-path pollen-robotics/mjlab_microduck/441tzs6d \
               --wandb-checkpoint-name model_3750.pt
    The env var matters: mjlab's runner restores common_step_counter (90 000)
    and the iteration (3750) from the checkpoint, which would jump every
    step-based curriculum below to its final stage in iteration 1 (seen in the
    first smoke test). MICRODUCK_WARM_START=1 (tasks/mdp.py Patch 5) restarts
    both at 0 after loading weights / normalizers / optimizer, so the
    curricula below are relative to THIS run's start. Do NOT warm-start from the stand
    expert (69u48n8l): its obs normalizer has twist std 0.005 — walking
    commands through it are a 40σ input.
  - ROBOT = robot_allcollisions.xml (true full-collision export; identical
    bodies/masses/ranges to groundcontact, 70 collision geoms vs 11), with the
    15 XL330 housing geoms NAMED (name_servo_collision_geoms) so a contact
    sensor can tell "a servo hit the floor" from "the shell hit the floor".
  - SERVO-PROTECTION COSTS, all mjlab-style (>= 0, negative weight), all ≈ 0
    during clean walking so they price only falls and bad recoveries:
      servo_impact    — housing contact force above 2 N (the event that strips
                        gears: a servo case taking the landing)
      head_impact     — head-subtree floor force above 15 N (≈2× body weight:
                        pushing off the head to get up is quasi-static ~7 N and
                        stays FREE — the 2026-07 lesson that an ungated head
                        penalty taxed the recovery strategy; a face-plant is a
                        60 N spike, measured)
      trunk_impact    — trunk shell floor force above 20 N (same logic)
      servo_acc_spike — servo joint |accel| above 300 rad/s² (impact
                        back-driving loads the gear train through the reflected
                        rotor inertia; CPU falls peak 450–550 regardless of
                        limp strategy — the policy's lever is HOW it lands)
      servo_stall     — servos pushing > 0.4 N·m at < 0.5 rad/s (a limb pinned
                        under the body while the servo fights it: the
                        convulsion / gear-strip / overheat case)
      gentle_rise     — trunk |a_z| (self-negating, POSITIVE weight)
    Ramped 25% → 100% after the recovery economics kick in, so the recovery
    discovery window is not taxed by its own failed attempts.
  - TOPPLE PUSHES: a second push event (topple_push) with velocity kicks far
    beyond the walking DR (ramped ±0.6 → ±1.2 m/s; a 1 m/s Δv topples this
    robot ~100% of the time in the CPU baseline), so falls are frequent
    on-policy data rather than rare accidents.
  - Backlash twin: robot_allcollisions_backlash.xml (add_backlash.py, 2° total)
    → Mjlab-VelStand-*-Backlash-MicroDuck mirror the base model as required.
  - NOT modelled on purpose (user decision 2026-09-09): the daemon limp. If the
    policy finds a gentler strategy with full authority, better let it.

Run-1 lesson (wandb 4otqmkb4, killed @1098, headless eval of ckpt 750):
  The walk transferred (iter 100 = source-run tracking/upright) and the topple
  ramp produced falls, but 0 recoveries ever: 73% of eval env-steps fallen,
  fallen action rate 1/5 of upright, torque 1/3 → the policy learned to LIE
  STILL. Two causes, both fixed here:
  (1) ATTEMPT TAX. The warm-start collapse pinned action_rate_l2 at -1.0 from
      step 0 (-1.5..-2/step, the largest cost in the stack). With a flat -0.5
      fallen tax, thrashing costs more than waiting → "do nothing" wins (the
      AGENTS.md smoothness-after-discovery rule, hit from the other side).
      Fix: action_rate / torque_rate are ×FALLEN_SMOOTHNESS_SCALE (0.1) while
      tilt > 40° (action_rate_l2_fallen_scaled) — the walk keeps its full tax.
  (2) SPAWN HOLE. 79% of falls end ON THE SIDE, 20% face-up, 0% face-down; the
      prone init only knew face-down/face-up. Fix: side_prob in the prone slice.
  Also: recovery ramps pulled earlier (walk needs no bootstrap window) and the
  crouch slice enlarged.

Run-2 lesson (wandb 1bqctpkq, killed @1085, per-spawn battery of ckpt 1000):
  standing 98% / crouch→stand 97% / face-down, face-up, side 0% — still lies
  still (fallen |Δa| a quarter of upright). Relieving the attempt tax was not
  enough: the warm-started walk has action std ≈ 0.2, random flailing from
  lying never yields a partial rise, so the potential-based terms never pay →
  no gradient at all (the from-scratch velstand runs discovered recovery with
  std 1.0 flailing, at the cost of the walk). The deployed stand expert
  (69u48n8l@9750) run through the same battery: 100/100/95% (side never
  trained!) within ~1 s. Fix: PpoWithExpertBc — fallen-gated behavior cloning
  toward that frozen expert after each PPO update (distill.py). RL keeps
  shaping the fall itself and the last mile.

Run-3 lesson (wandb 4lflk7ii, @1060): IT STANDS UP from front and back — and
  the walk died at the first BC pass (iteration 8: 20 Adam steps at 1e-3 on a
  few hundred fallen frames; fall terminations 2 → 72 by iteration 12, then a
  falls→fallen-frames→more-BC loop; yaw tracking error 0.9 → 3.4 rad/s).
  Nothing constrained the shared weights on upright frames. Fix (distill.py):
  the warm-start WALK checkpoint is a second frozen teacher anchoring frames
  with tilt < 25°; stand expert on tilt > 35°; PPO alone in between and for
  everything the reward adds on top. BC lr 3e-4, min mini-batch 512. 40-iter
  check at 64 envs with 50% prone spawns + 1 m/s pushes: fallen frac 0.44 →
  0.33 while upright lin-vel error stayed 0.22 m/s (run 3's recipe destroyed
  the walk in 12 iterations under milder conditions). Impact costs were confirmed real but weak (face-plant
  spikes 129 N at 0.5% of steps ≈ -0.3 per fall vs ~7/step walking) — to be
  raised ×5 once recoveries exist, not before.

Run-4 (wandb 6op8a8u8) WORKS, on the robot too → published reference. Sim
  benchmark vs the deployed walk→limp→stand pipeline (3 seeds): recovers 88-95%
  vs 83-86% of push falls, 2.7 s vs 3.3 s median, zero servo-housing contact vs
  50 ms/fall, trunk impact 0 vs 14 N, stall halved; forward speed equal to the
  walk expert; head impact EQUAL (~32 N) — the open target. Turn-in-place yaw
  rate drifted 0.34 → 0.12 rad/s over training (parked, not critical).
  Robot feedback: (a) convulsions rising from the BACK after a real fall — in sim
  face-up LANDINGS after a push recover 58-77% vs 100% from a face-up SPAWN; the
  stand expert has the same hole (71%): a real fall leaves the legs anywhere,
  HOME-pose spawns never show that. (b) occasional backward overshoot after a
  front stand-up — NOT reproduced in sim (0/192 re-falls).

Runs 5-6 (axr82ws4, padquu42; resumed from 5999) — ROLLED BACK 2026-09-13:
  tried post-fall-like prone spawns (randomize_servo_joints_uniform, kept in
  mdp.py, OFF here), servo_stall ×3, then fallen smoothness 0.4 / gentle_rise ×4
  / BC coef 0.3. Lessons: servo_stall ×3 made the rise BALLISTIC ("high torque at
  low velocity" IS a slow careful push-up) — robot overshoot + fall back; the
  stand expert is only 83% on randomized-joint face-up spawns and the student
  plateaued there (teacher ceiling); run 6 gave a mild push-recovery gain but
  face-up stayed at 85% and front stand-ups re-fell 9/190 (5999: 0/192), cause
  unknown. Not better than 5999 on the robot → back to this recipe.

Rough+backlash run 1 (wy8gcaus) — CATASTROPHIC, root cause FIXED in mdp.py:
  every fallen-spawn function wrote an ABSOLUTE trunk z (0.05-0.09 m); rough env
  origins span 0-0.21 m (slope pyramids) → robots spawned inside the terrain
  from iter 700 (prone spawns on) → value loss 0.6 → 42, entropy 5 → 33. Spawn z
  is now origin-relative (_env_origin_z). The flat run with the same constants
  was stable throughout. Prod recipe = THIS file on
  Mjlab-VelStand-Rough-Backlash-MicroDuck, warm start from 6op8a8u8@5999.

REBASED (2026-07, audit follow-up) on the velocity recipe — the proven
walker — instead of the abandoned older recipe the old velstand used.
The 2026-07 audit found the old design starved the walk: only ~25% of
experience was clean commanded walking (2/3 prone resets + fallen envs farming
recovery reward for full 20 s episodes), the recovery rewards taxed the gait
(always-on posture double-counting, a bounce incentive from com_upward_velocity
below walk height), and the prone init dropped the robot from 0.20–0.25 m
(function defaults — a violent uncontrolled impact opening most episodes).

Design now:
  - Walk layer  = make_microduck_velocity_env_cfg, verbatim. Everything the
    good walker has (tracking weights, air_time, turn-in-place bucket, fixed
    command ranges, DR/noise/obs) flows in by construction.
  - Robot       = all-collision standup XML (body can physically lie down).
  - Recovery    = a small reward layer GATED on actually-being-fallen
    (trunk z < 0.10 m OR tilt > 40°): contributes exactly zero during clean
    walking, steers only when down. upright_linear gives an orientation
    gradient everywhere; com_upward_velocity pays for rising. (The old
    com_height_recovery was dropped: flat/no-gradient inside its band and
    redundant with the two above — audit finding 3.)
  - Impact penalties (trunk/head) discourage hard landings, ungated.
  - joint_torque_rate_l2 (standup's proven anti-jitter) for transfer
    smoothness — penalizes torque CHANGE, never blocks the recovery flip.

Run-5 lesson (crouch endpoint): recoveries walked nicely but parked in a deep
crouch just past the 40° gates — every dense recovery term stops paying there,
and the recovery_success bounty demanded z > 0.105, above the policy's real
standing envelope (0.084–0.096), so it never fired. Fixes: (1) shared
"recovery complete" definition (tilt < 25° AND z > 0.09 — reachable) for the
bounty and (2) a fallen_tax hysteresis that keeps taxing after a fall until
that definition is met, and (3) height_progress — a potential-based Δz term
giving the crouch→stand last mile the dense gradient nothing else provides.

Run-6 lesson (still parked at 4k): fixing the economics wasn't enough — the
bounty fired (rising recovery_success curve) but stayed exploration-rare,
because the last mile got almost no on-policy DATA: a prone episode spends
most of its 5 s fallen budget getting TO the crouch, then fallen_too_long
recycles it right at the frontier. The old velstand learned recovery fast
precisely because 2/3 prone resets + 20 s episodes made fallen-state data
abundant (at the cost of the walk). Run-6 recovers that data density without
the starvation: (1) crouch_prob reverse-curriculum slice — reset directly
into random mid-recovery crouches, dense last-mile data from step 0; (2)
fallen timeout 5 → 8 s; (3) economics at 800 (walk is stable by ~750) and
the whole prone ramp pulled ~500 iters earlier.

Run-7 lesson (headless eval of run 6 vs run 5 @4k, 2026-07-21): the crouch
slice WORKED — run 6 stands truly vertical (tilt ≈1°, z ≈0.117) and recovers
94–97% from crouch inits — but prone recovery collapsed to 0% (run 5: gets up
from prone but parks at ~30°). Cause: run 6 turned on tax + bounty + prone +
crouch ALL at iter 800, deleting the tax-free natural-fall window (500→1200 in
run 5) where prone-flip exploration was cheap and the dense progress terms
alone taught it — run 5's recovery_success was already firing the moment its
weight turned on at 1200. With the tax live from 800 and hopeless prone
episodes bleeding -0.5/step for the full 8 s timeout, the run-3 avoidance/
freeze mechanism re-emerged for prone states while PPO capacity went to the
easy crouch-slice reward. Run-7: keep the crouch slice (validated) + 8 s
timeout, restore econ to 1200 and prone to the run-5 ramp (1500+), crouch
slice alone from 800 (harmless pre-econ: it just adds stand-tall data).

Phases (as before, but with a recovery backstop):
  Phase 1 (0 → 500 iters): `fell_over` termination active (70°) → clean
    walking first.
  Phase 2 (500+): fell_over disabled (limit → π) so falls become recovery
    opportunities — but `fallen_too_long` (5 s continuously down) recycles
    failed recoveries instead of letting them farm the full 20 s episode.
  Phase 3 (1500+): prone-init ramp: face-down first (easier), face-up mixed
    in later, capped at 45% prone so the walking data share stays ≥ ~55%
    (was 2/3 prone → ~25% walking share).
