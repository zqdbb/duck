//! Frames out to a WebSocket **this robot dials**, for a Space that runs a model on them.
//!
//! # This is the fallback, and WebRTC is the default
//!
//! **A consumer should use WebRTC**, which carries encrypted media, a control channel on the same
//! session and a return path, and which reaches a data centre because the robot offers a relay
//! candidate (`remote-access-design.md` §6). `docs/faq.md` is the decision, in the shape somebody
//! arrives at it. This module is for the narrow case WebRTC serves badly: a **program** consuming
//! **frames only** on a **long-running** stream, where a relay's metered bandwidth is the cost
//! that matters.
//!
//! In that case an outbound WebSocket needs nobody's relay. **The robot already proves this every
//! second it is reachable**: `relay.rs` holds an outbound HTTPS stream to a Space right now, and
//! nothing about a home router objects. So the frames go the same way the registration does —
//! outward — and NAT stops being a participant.
//!
//! ```text
//!   Space  ──media.stream {url: "wss://…/frames"}──►  rendezvous  ──►  this robot
//!   robot  ═══════════ JPEG frames, outbound wss, direct ═══════════►  Space
//! ```
//!
//! The rendezvous carries **the instruction and not the pixels**, which is the property that makes
//! this scale where relaying payload through a shared service would not: one small envelope per
//! session, on a service the mini fleet also depends on, and the bytes go point to point.
//!
//! **This was written when the relay endpoint was dead and WebRTC could not connect from a data
//! centre at all.** That is fixed (§6), so the reason this exists is now the narrow one above and
//! not "the alternative does not work". What survives of the original argument is the cost: a
//! relay is metered per Hugging Face account at 10 GB a month, and a stream that runs all day
//! spends an allowance its owner also needs for being *watched*.
//!
//! # What it is not
//!
//! **Not a replacement for WebRTC, and not the path to reach for first.** There is no return
//! media path and no control channel, so nothing here helps a browser *watch* a robot, carries
//! audio, or closes a teleop loop; driving means a separate JSON-RPC call over the rendezvous.
//! Encryption is the receiver's TLS rather than DTLS-SRTP, terminating at a server instead of at
//! the peer. A consumer that is not all three of program, frames-only and long-running wants §6.
//!
//! # This half is portable, and that is deliberate
//!
//! [`pump`] takes a channel of already-encoded frames and knows nothing about GStreamer, so the
//! reconnect, the backoff, the framing and the counters are all exercised on a laptop against a
//! fake server. What touches [`crate::pipeline::Frames`] is [`encode_frames`], which is the thin
//! linux-only half: read a frame, turn it upright, JPEG it, hand it over. The same split
//! `session.rs` has, for the same reason — every failure worth testing here is a timing failure.
