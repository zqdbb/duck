# Simulation: the same daemons, a body in MuJoCo

**Status:** built and in use. `robotd --sim`, `tofd --sim` and `mediad --sim-camera` are here, with
`microduck_rl`'s `duck-body` serving the other half; the containers (§8), the ether (§5) and the
per-duck cameras all run from `scripts/duck-sim`. Measured: the daemon holds `50.0 of 50.0 Hz · 0
missed` against a MuJoCo body, detects a seated boot from the simulator's own joint angles, and
`robotctl robot init` runs the sitstand policy until the duck is upright and stays there; four ducks
in containers sing a full chorale over the ether. How to use it is
[`docs/robot/simulation.md`](../robot/simulation.md); this page is the design.

The goal is a duck you develop against exactly as you develop against a robot: the same binaries,
the same units, the same `robotctl`, the same `duckctl open` — with the body in MuJoCo instead of on
the desk. Not a mock, and not a test harness. A twin, with a written-down boundary.

## 1. What using it looks like

One command to get a duck. After that it is a robot, and you already know the commands.

**What works today** (`scripts/duck-sim`, one duck, no container):

```
scripts/duck-sim               # a window opens, the duck stands up, and it is yours
scripts/duck-sim drive         # walk it forward, then stop
scripts/duck-sim ctl health    # or anything else robotctl does
scripts/duck-sim log
scripts/duck-sim down
```

It builds what is missing, writes the params, finds the ONNX Runtime in the RL repo's venv, starts
both halves and stands the duck up. Three things it exists to stop anyone typing, because none is
guessable: policies live at `/opt/robot/daemon/current` on a robot and in this repo on a laptop;
`ort` dlopens a libonnxruntime a laptop does not have; and a unix socket path is capped at ~108
bytes, so the state directory has to be short.

**Where it goes**, once the containers are in:

```
duck-sim up 4                  # four ducks, sharing one MuJoCo window
duck-sim shell duck-a          # you are on duck-a
```

Inside, nothing is special:

```
duck-a # robotctl health
duck-a # robotctl configure
duck-a # robotctl chorale
duck-a # journalctl -u robotd -f
```

And from your own shell, exactly as with a robot on the desk:

```
duckctl open duck-a
scripts/dev-push.sh microduck@duck-a
```

Four rules the harness holds itself to, because a development tool that needs a runbook does not get
used:

**No setup step anybody has to remember.** `duck-sim up` on a machine that has never run it builds
the rootfs, fetches what is missing and says so — once. Whatever it genuinely cannot do for you, it
prints as the exact line to paste, in the style the rest of `scripts/` already uses.

**Defaults are the common case.** No count means one duck. No scene means the apartment. No
`--cameras` means no cameras, because most sessions do not need them and they are what costs.

**Nothing you cannot stop.** Every duck runs as a systemd unit, so `duck-sim down` is a
`systemctl stop` — not a key combination. That rule was bought with a container that had to be
killed from a second terminal because `Ctrl-]` is `AltGr + )` on a French keyboard.

**A duck is addressable by name.** `duck-a`, `duck-b`, and each gets its own machine-id — so
`robotctl quack` sounds different on each one, since a duck's voice is generated from its serial.
Four ducks in a chorale should not be four copies of one voice.

## 2. Where the seam is

`duck_control::io::RobotIo` — six methods, and the only place a simulator is allowed to exist:

```rust
fn read(&mut self) -> Result<Sensors>;          // joints and IMU, one transaction
fn write(&mut self, targets: &JointTargets) -> Result<()>;
fn set_gain(&mut self, kp: u16) -> Result<()>;
fn set_torque(&mut self, on: bool) -> Result<()>;
fn slow_sensors(&mut self) -> Result<SlowSensors>;   // volts, per-joint temperature
```

Above it, nothing changes: the 50 Hz loop, the ONNX policies, `Safety`, fall detection, odometry,
kinematics, maploc, every IPC call, all of `robotctl` and `duckctl`. Below it there is one thing —
`DynamixelIo` — and the IMU is not separate from it, because on this robot the IMU is a Dynamixel
node read in the same `sync_read` as the fifteen servos.

`FakeIo` was already a full implementation of this trait, which is why `cargo test` needs no
hardware. `RemoteIo` is the third.

**Where a sensor's daemon *is* its driver, replace neither.** `tofd --fake` already synthesises
frames at the loop level, and `tof/src/sensor.rs` says in as many words that the off-board `Sensor`
"is not a fake sensor and must never become one". Simulated depth feeds that existing loop. The same
reasoning will apply to anything else whose driver cannot be separated from its hardware.

## 3. The body protocol

TCP, newline-delimited JSON, one request and one answer per call. `duck_control::sim` is the
implementation and carries the reasoning; the short version:

* **TCP** because a unix path is capped at `SUN_LEN` (~108 bytes), and because the simulator must be
  reachable from outside whatever the daemons run in — a container on Linux, a Linux VM with MuJoCo
  on the host on macOS.
* **JSON** because a tick is ~1 KB, so 50 KB/s, against being able to read a frame with `nc` and
  write the other end in twenty lines of Python. A packed struct shared across two repositories in
  two languages is how this project has lost days before.
* **`TCP_NODELAY`**, not as a micro-optimisation: Nagle delays a small write up to ~40 ms, twice the
  tick, and it would present as a slow simulator.

Requests are `{"op":"hello"|"read"|"write"|"gain"|"torque"|"slow", …}`. The handshake carries
`protocol` (currently 1) and is checked in both directions, because the two halves live in two
repositories and "your simulator is old" and "your daemon is old" are otherwise the same symptom.

**The simulator reports in the robot's own units** — radians, rad/s, mA, and the IMU already
resolved into the trunk frame. MuJoCo knows its own model's ordering, scaling and frames; a
translation layer on this side would be a second place for that to live and drift.

**A dead simulator is one bad tick.** MuJoCo compiles its model, so changing the number of ducks
restarts it, and the ducks must live through that. A broken connection is an error returned to the
caller and a reconnect on the next call — no backoff thread, because the control loop is the retry
timer.

## 4. Faking the radio costs nothing

Presence is already an IPC contract on `robotd`'s own socket: `chorale.subscribe`,
`chorale.beacon` (what to advertise) and `chorale.heard` (what was heard, with an *age* rather than
a timestamp). And `btd` is a **client** of robotd, not a server — so a simulated ether impersonates
nothing and steals no socket path. One process holds one connection per duck, collects what each
wants to advertise, and delivers it to the others with an RSSI derived from the distance between
their bodies.

No change to `robotd`, no protocol work, and three things better than the radio for development:
the age-based synchronisation path is exercised for real; RSSI from ground truth makes range cutoffs
and asymmetric links a knob rather than a staging problem; and `from` is documented as an identity
for de-duplication only, so rotating it on a timer turns the address-rotation bug that cost a day
into a regression test.

## 5. The radio has to be bad, or the bug hides

A perfect ether hides the bugs a real one causes, and this is measured rather than argued. Four ducks
in the twin converged on one piece every time — simultaneous starts, staggered starts, no difference
— because every duck was visible to every other instantly and losslessly. The one property that
causes the field bug was the one the simulator did not model.

`duck-ether --discovery <s> --loss <f> --seed <n>` makes it a bad radio: a duck takes a while to be
*noticed*, per pair and timed from when it goes on the air, and a fraction of deliveries is dropped.
Per pair because it is the asymmetry that splits a flock — one delay shared by everybody cannot
produce it. Seeded, because a flaky radio is only useful for debugging if its flakiness repeats.

**The reproduction**, four ducks, `a` and `b` singing twelve seconds before `c` and `d` join:

```
duck-ether --discovery 90 --loss 0.3 --seed 3
```

On main's chorale:

| duck | part | bar | roster |
|---|---|---|---|
| a | *not singing* | — | 1 in range |
| b | bass | 4 | 3 voices |
| c | alto | 4 | 2 voices |
| d | bass | 2 | 2 voices |

Which is the field report — "sometimes nothing happens, sometimes two different songs" — with
disagreeing rosters and a duplicated part as well.

**What it does not yet prove.** With `chorale-election` merged the same scenario still splits (bars
5, 12 and 8: three timelines). But at `--discovery 20 --loss 0.4` *both* converge, so ninety seconds
of discovery is harsher than that branch was written for, and this is not evidence the fix fails on a
robot. The experiment worth running is a sweep — the discovery value at which each version stops
converging — which is now a loop over a number rather than four robots and a room.

## 6. Architecture follows the host

Every artifact this project builds is aarch64. The attractive idea was to run the board's own
binaries on an x86 laptop under `qemu-user` — same bytes, perfect provenance. It was measured, twice,
and the two results point opposite ways.

**The daemon alone is fine.** CI's real aarch64 artifact, emulated on an x86 laptop:

| | |
|---|---|
| `robotctl health` | `50.0 of 50.0 Hz · 3804 ticks · 0 missed` |
| host CPU | 4.7% of one core, nine ONNX sessions loaded, policy driving |
| policy inference | 0.029 ms against a 20 ms tick (measured natively) |

Throughput was never the risk — and the slow part of a real tick, the Dynamixel sync-read, is a
local socket here.

**Under systemd it is not.** Booted in `systemd-nspawn`, aarch64 systemd 257 comes up in 8.7 s and
then cannot start anything:

```
robotd.service:            (code=exited, status=226/NAMESPACE)
systemd-journald.service:  (code=exited, status=243/CREDENTIALS)
systemd-logind, systemd-tmpfiles, console-getty: the same
```

qemu-user 8.2 does not translate the new mount API (`fsopen`, `move_mount`, `open_tree`) that
systemd 257 uses for per-unit namespaces and credentials. Per-unit hardening is the entire reason to
boot a container rather than run seven processes in a terminal, so losing it loses the point. Newer
qemu may fix it; in Debian 13 and Ubuntu 25.04 the static packages are transitional and the real
binaries are dynamically linked, so it is a build-from-source question rather than an apt line.

So the twin runs **the host's architecture**:

* **x86 host** — an amd64 container and a native build. Real units, real hardening, real journal;
  everything except CI's exact bytes.
* **arm64 host (Apple Silicon)** — an arm64 container running the robot's own signed artifact,
  natively. Full provenance, no emulation, identical commands.

The consequence for the update path is small and worth stating plainly: `robotctl update apply` runs
end to end — preflight, signature, artifact hash, compatibility, health gate, auto-rollback — because
that is how `dev-push.sh` installs. What an x86 twin cannot do is install a *published* release.
`board-test.sh` already covers the real artifact on the real architecture in CI.

## 7. What it is and is not a twin of

Identical, because it is the same code on the same path: the control loop, policies, safety, fall
detection, kinematics, odometry, maploc, the whole IPC surface and its clients, the chorale's
election and beat, the systemd units with their real `User=`, groups, `RuntimeDirectory=` and
hardening, and the updater.

Modelled — the real code path, synthesised input: actuator response (BAM models fitted to the real
XL330s), the IMU, ToF depth, RSSI, the camera image, and release provenance on an x86 host.

Absent — not exercised at all: the Dynamixel bus driver, the BLE radio, the camera ISP and rkaiq's
3A, the NPU, the hardware encoder and its RGA path, thermals and battery.

**A useful check on that list:** run a week of real bugs past it. A `videoflip` that cost 22 fps by
breaking the encoder's zero-copy path to the RGA; a 3A engine missing a stream-start event; an
auto-exposure loop that converges once and stops; an INT8 head whose score channel collapses to two
values; a servo bus dropping reads. The twin would have caught **none** of them. That is not a flaw
in the design, it is the boundary of it — and hardware stays the only place the drivers are real.

## 8. A simulated duck is a duck, and says so once

A duck in MuJoCo registers with the rendezvous and appears in its owner's Hugging Face robot list
next to the real ones. That is worth having — it is the whole remote-access path, exercisable
without hardware — and it is worth being unmistakable about, because a client that cannot tell the
two apart ends with somebody driving a simulation and wondering why the robot on the shelf is still.

**One fact, declared once.** `configd --simulated <serial>` is the only place it is stated.
`system.info` carries it, `mediad` learns it there — it already asks that question at startup for
the name — and puts `simulated: true` in the `meta` it registers with. `robotctl system info` prints
it. Nothing else infers it, and in particular no client keys on a serial beginning `sim-`: that is a
convention three places would have to agree on and one of them would get wrong.

`mediad --sim-camera` sets it too. Not a second source of truth — a backstop for the one case that
would be wrong: `configd` is asked once, with a timeout, on a machine where every daemon starts at
the same instant, and a late answer would register a simulated duck as hardware. The two cannot
disagree, because there is no arrangement in which the frames come from a simulator and the robot
they belong to is real.

**Identity is why the flag takes a value.** A simulated duck has no SoC serial and no per-duck
`/etc/machine-id` — four ducks in one scene share their laptop's, so they would evict each other
from the listing one at a time, and macOS has no such file at all, so none of them would register.
`sim-duck-a` is stable per duck and across restarts, which is what `hardware_id` has to be
(`remote-access-design.md` §3.7). The robot's name derives from it exactly as a real one's does, so a
duck in the twin is `duck-eb55` rather than the hostname of the machine running it.

**The account is the robot's own flow, not a credential handed to it.** `updaterd` runs in the
simulator with `--token` pointing into the state directory, and `robotctl account login` is RFC 8628
against Hugging Face: a code, typed on a phone or a browser, exactly as on a robot. `mediad` polls
that file and registers when it appears, so a duck signed in mid-session needs no restart. Nothing
about the credential path is simulated, which is the point — it is the half of remote access that is
easiest to get subtly wrong and hardest to test on a board.

The consequence to know is the rendezvous's, not ours: peers are keyed by token, so one duck per
account is listed at a time. Each duck runs its own device flow, so that is a rule about accounts
rather than a limit of the simulator.

## 9. GStreamer is not the Linux part

`mediad`'s pipeline was gated `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]` whole, which was true of the daemon when
the only source was a board camera and stopped being true when `Source::Sim` arrived. About 230
lines of `pipeline.rs` are genuinely hardware: `v4l2src`, the driver's buffer pool and the
`GstVideoMeta` allocation query, and the sensor mode read out of the media topology. The rest —
appsrc, the tee, the appsink, `webrtcsink`, the encoder-setup signal — is GStreamer, and runs
wherever GStreamer does.

So the gate is `any(target_os = "linux", feature = "gstreamer")`: assumed on the robot's OS, opt-in
elsewhere. A developer's machine gets the real daemon, the real console and real WebRTC against a
simulated camera for two Homebrew formulae, and `Source::Camera` off Linux is a clear error rather
than a missing arm.

Two, not one, and the second is a trap worth writing down: Homebrew's `gstreamer` links
`libgstnice.dylib` into a separate `libnice-gstreamer` formula that it does not depend on. Without
that formula the link dangles, `webrtcbin` has no ICE agent, and everything works — the pipeline,
the camera, the rendezvous registration — until the first consumer asks for a pad and the session
dies inside a GStreamer thread with "libnice elements are not available". A build check cannot see
it, so `scripts/duck-sim` checks the elements rather than the pkg-config file. `exposure.rs` stays Linux-only and that is not packaging — it writes V4L2
controls through `ioctl`, and there is no sensor behind a simulated source to meter.

Off by default there, deliberately: Homebrew's `gstreamer` is one merged formula that pulls gtk4 and
ffmpeg with it, and somebody working on `robotd` should not need it to run `cargo check`. The cost is
that no CI job compiles that combination — CI is `ubuntu-*` throughout — so it is a developer
running it that keeps it working. A `macos-latest` job doing `cargo check -p mediad --features
gstreamer` is what would change that, and it is left out on purpose: CI is already slow and macOS
runners are slower.

## 10. The harness

One MuJoCo process, one window, N duck bodies in one scene, so ducks share physics and can bump into
each other. `microduck_rl` owns that half: it already has the scenes, the BAM actuator models and
mjlab, and serving a body to a daemon is the mirror of the sim2real it does today.

Each duck is a `systemd-nspawn` container — no daemon, no image format, a container is a directory —
booted from one Debian 13 Trixie rootfs (`mmdebstrap`, unprivileged, 238 MB, under three minutes)
with an overlay per duck. Run each as a service (`systemd-run --unit=duck-a …`) so `duck-sim down` is
a `systemctl stop`: a duck you cannot quit is not much of a duck.

`machinectl shell duck-a` is the way in, `duckctl open duck-a` the way to watch, and
`scripts/dev-push.sh microduck@duck-a` the way to install a build.

Two limits that follow from the physics rather than the plumbing. **Ducks do not hot-join** — MuJoCo
compiles its model, so changing the count restarts the simulator, which is why `RemoteIo` reconnects.
And **camera rendering is the scaling wall**, not the bipeds: N offscreen renders at 30 fps cost far
more than N fifteen-DoF bodies, so cameras should be opt-in per duck. The 45 Hz health gate makes
both a hard edge rather than a soft one — too many ducks and they do not get slow, they go
*unhealthy* and the updater starts rolling releases back.

## 11. Three ways to pick the wrong model

Each of these presents as "the duck is on its back", and each cost an hour.

**`scene_walk.xml` has no collisions.** It includes the model the RL work trains against, whose
actuator default classes carry `contype="0" conaffinity="0"`. The duck sinks through a floor the
scene really does contain — trunk z from 0.120 to -0.105 in a second — and the daemon reports a robot
lying down, correctly. `scene.xml` includes `robot_allcollisions.xml`, and is what a twin wants.

**`qpos0` is not a pose.** Every joint at zero is a shape this robot is never in; the daemon measured
0.41 rad from its home frame and quite reasonably tried to stand up a robot that was already folded.
The scenes carry `INIT`, `STAND`, `SIT` and `FOLD`, and `STAND` matches
`duck_control::DEFAULT_POSITION` — whose right leg is *mirrored*, not symmetric, which is worth
reading rather than assuming.

**Torque belongs on at startup.** `robotd` never enables torque when it starts, because a daemon
restarted by an update must leave a standing robot standing — the servos are already holding. A
simulator that starts limp has its duck on the floor before the first read.

The boot the daemon is actually written for is `--keyframe SIT`: a duck found folded, which it
recognises and stands up with the sitstand policy.

## 12. Known material to reuse

`~/MISC/microduck_maploc` (outdated in every other respect) has two things worth taking: a simulated
VL53L5CX in `sim/tof_sensor.py` — 8×8 zones, 45° square FoV, 4 m range, noise that grows with
distance, 15 Hz — and `sim/assets/apartment.xml`, an indoor scene of 83 geoms. A room is worth much
more than a ground plane to maploc, to wander, and to anything that hides.
