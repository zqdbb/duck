//! Build tooling: package, sign and promote robot releases.
//!
//! This is the **publisher** side of the update contract. It never ships to a robot —
//! notably it links the full `minisign` crate (which can sign), while `updaterd` links
//! only `minisign-verify` (which cannot).
//!
//! Written in Rust rather than as a shell script for one reason: it reuses the exact
//! same `minisign`, `tar`, `zstd` and `sha2` crates the updater's tests use. A shell
//! version would depend on separately-installed `minisign`/`tar`/`zstd` binaries whose
//! behaviour could drift from what the robot verifies with — which is the last place a
//! difference should be allowed to hide.
//!
//! ```text
//!   cargo xtask package --version 1.2.3 --channel daemon --bin-dir <dir> --out dist/
//!   cargo xtask sign    --dir dist/ --key secret.key
//!   cargo xtask promote --version 1.2.3 --staging-tag daemon-staging-v1.2.3 \
//!                       --stable-tag daemon-v1.2.3 \
//!                       --repo ORG/REPO --out dist/ --key secret.key
//! ```
//!
//! `promote` is what makes §16.3's `staging → stable` real: it emits a *stable*
//! manifest carrying the **same artifact bytes** already validated in staging —
//! same sha256 — rather than rebuilding. Promotion is therefore a re-signing, and
//! what ships is provably what was tested.
//!
//! The stable manifest points at the artifact on the *stable* release, which
//! `promote.yml` uploads alongside it. It used to point back at the staging release
//! instead, to avoid a second copy of the bytes. That made every stable release
//! depend on a tag named as if it were disposable — and it was duly disposed of:
//! deleting the `daemon-staging-v0.1.x` releases left three stable releases pointing
//! at nothing. The sha256 in the manifest is verified on the robot before install
//! (`updater::verify::verify_sha256`), so a copy that diverged could never install
//! silently, which is what the single-copy rule was protecting against.
