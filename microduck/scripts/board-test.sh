# Cross-compile for the board and exercise the result on real ARM64 Linux.
#
# Target: Radxa Zero 3 (RK3566, Cortex-A55 → aarch64) running Armbian 26.2.x.
#
# The intended userland is Debian 13 (Trixie). Armbian 26.2 also offers Ubuntu Noble
# and a minimal Debian Bookworm, so we build against an older glibc than any of them
# and verify against all three — Trixie first, since that is what will be flashed.
# Keeping the floor low costs nothing and means a fallback image needs no rebuild.
#
# The kernel (6.1.115 Rockchip BSP) is irrelevant to us: flock, SO_PEERCRED and
# statvfs long predate it.
#
# Not a substitute for hardware, but it catches everything that only appears off the
# dev machine: cross-linking (notably `zstd`'s C code), glibc floors, unix-socket and
# file-permission semantics, and anything that quietly depended on macOS. On an arm64 host —
# an Apple Silicon Mac, or CI's runner — these containers run *natively*, so it's fast. On
# x86_64 every process inside them is emulated, and the shell-heavy checks below dominate.
#
# Usage:  scripts/board-test.sh
#
# Requires: cargo-zigbuild, zig, docker — and on an x86_64 host, binfmt registered for arm64,
# or the containers fail to exec at all.

# lower (2.31) because the risk is the *build host*, not the target: an unpinned build links

# The release is a real artifact, built by xtask package from the cross-compiled binaries and
# the include list read out of the packaging workflow. Not the fixture releases the engine uses:
# those carry no systemd units by design, and units are the whole subject here.

# the state that would otherwise need install.sh to be re-run by hand.
