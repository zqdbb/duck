//! The official policy set: what is installed, what the Hub offers, and moving between them.
//!
//! **Why this is in `updaterd` at all.** It is not an update in the component sense — there is no
//! manifest, no signature, no health gate and no rollback, because a policy is not a binary
//! (`docs/design/policy-channel-design.md` §2). What it needs is a network stack and root, and
//! this is the daemon that has both: `robotd` has neither by design, and `robotctl` must not link
//! an HTTP client because it is the tool that has to work when everything else is broken.
//!
//! **Why it exists.** A board installs its set from a pin that ships inside the daemon release
//! (`scripts/seed-policies.sh`), which makes the pin a *minimum* rather than a ceiling: without
//! something to move past it, a retrained gait would still need a daemon release to reach a
//! robot, which is the thing the whole channel was meant to stop. This is that something.
//!
//! The layout is the seeder's, and deliberately: `releases/<name>/` beside a `current` symlink,
//! swapped by rename. So a set installed here and a set installed by the seeder are the same
//! kind of thing, and each carries a `.source` record saying where it came from — which is how
//! [`check`] knows what repo to ask without anyone configuring it twice.
