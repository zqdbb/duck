//! Relay candidates, so a consumer that cannot reach this robot directly still can.
//!
//! `webrtcsink` gathers **host** candidates (this robot's own addresses) and **srflx** ones (what
//! a STUN server says its public address is). Between two peers on one network the host
//! candidates pair immediately. Between a robot behind a home router and a consumer behind
//! whatever a cloud provider gives a container, srflx-to-srflx needs both NATs to allow a hole to
//! be punched — often they do, and often enough they do not, and the failure looks like a session
//! that negotiates perfectly and carries nothing.
//!
//! A **TURN** server is a relay in the middle: a peer reserves an address on it and hands that out
//! as a `relay` candidate, and the other side simply sends there. It always works, at the cost of
//! somebody's bandwidth, which is why it is the last resort ICE tries rather than the first.
//!
//! # Only the robot offers one, and that is not a simplification
//!
//! A connection needs **one** relay candidate, not two: if this robot offers one, a consumer that
//! can reach the internet at all can use it. So the credentials live here and a consumer needs
//! none — which matters more than it sounds, because `aiortc`'s STUN client works where its TURN
//! client does not, so a Python consumer *cannot* be the side that relays.
//! `reachy_mini`'s #1182 established this and it is the same arrangement here.
//!
//! # The credentials are short-lived, and fetching them must never be in the way
//!
//! Hugging Face hosts a proxy that mints Cloudflare TURN credentials for an account, which is why
//! this needs the same token the relay signs in with and no new secret anywhere. They expire, so
//! a task refreshes them at half their lifetime.
//!
//! **[`Relays::uris`] never blocks and never fails**, and that is the whole design of this module.
//! Its only caller runs inside GStreamer's `consumer-added` signal, where the SDP offer for that
//! consumer is not generated until the handler returns — so an HTTP request there would delay
//! every connection, including the LAN ones that will never use a relay, by however long the
//! proxy takes to answer. It reads what the refresher last stored, or nothing.
