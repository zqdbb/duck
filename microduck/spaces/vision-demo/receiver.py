"""The endpoint a duck dials, and the frames it leaves behind.

**The robot connects to us, which is the whole reason this exists.** Pulling the camera through
the rendezvous means WebRTC, and WebRTC between a robot behind a home router and a container in a
data centre needs a relay candidate to fall back on (`remote-access-design.md` §6) — somebody's
bandwidth, metered against the robot owner's Hugging Face allowance, for every frame of a stream
that is only going to be decoded by a program. An outbound WebSocket needs nobody's: the robot
already holds one to a Space every second it is reachable. So the direction is inverted, NAT
stops being a participant, and this is the socket at the far end.

`mediad`'s `stream.rs` is the other half. It sends one text frame describing what is coming, then
one binary message per JPEG, upright, at the rate it was asked for.

## Whose camera this is, which is not optional

This endpoint is public — a Space's URL is a Space's URL — so anything that can reach the internet
can open it. Two things would go wrong without a check: anybody could push frames into somebody
else's demo, and worse, a visitor could be shown a stranger's camera. So the robot presents its
own account token on the handshake and this resolves it through `whoami-v2`, exactly as the
rendezvous does, and frames are filed under the username it answers with. A visitor sees the
robots on their own account and nothing else.

The token never leaves this process and is never stored: it is resolved once per connection and
what is kept is the username.
