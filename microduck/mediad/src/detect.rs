//! Looking for other ducks in the frames already on the tee.
//!
//! `architecture.md` §2 wants perception next to the sensor — deriving features rather than shipping
//! pixels to `robotd` — and §5.3 wants a frame on demand. The raw branch of the tee has existed for
//! both since the pipeline was written; this is the first thing to read it.
//!
//! **A thread, not a task.** Inference is 60 ms of blocking work per frame and the tokio runtime
//! here serves WebRTC signalling; a detector that occupied one of its workers for a tenth of every
//! second would make session setup stutter for no reason anybody could find.
//!
//! **Paced, and the pace is a thermal number.** Flat out on a Radxa Zero 3 the detector reaches
//! 95 °C and the CPU throttles to 408 MHz — a robot that walks badly to see well. Two looks a
//! second is plenty for "is there a duck over there" and costs about a tenth of one core.
