"""JSON-RPC to a duck over the rendezvous, with no WebRTC in the path at all.

The other two transports negotiate: they exchange SDP and ICE so the two ends can find a route
between them, and then speak WebRTC over it. That works on one network, and across NATs it works
*when a relay candidate exists* — which now it does (`remote-access-design.md` §6), but the
control channel is hostage to it either way, because SCTP rides the same candidate pair as the
media. A relay that is rate-limited, metered out, or briefly not answering takes the click with
it, for a call whose whole payload is a few hundred bytes.

This needs none of it. The rendezvous already relays what is wanted: `handle_peer_message` in its
`app.py` forwards **every key of a `peer` envelope except `type` and `sessionId`** verbatim to the
session partner, without looking at `sdp` or `ice`. So a `peer` envelope carrying an `rpc` key is a
control call, and `mediad::relay`'s control lane answers it out of the same routing table and the
same per-lane sockets the datachannel uses.

    POST /send  {"type": "peer", "sessionId": S, "rpc": {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, …}}
    SSE         {"type": "peer", "sessionId": S, "rpc": {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "result": …}}

Two HTTP verbs, one stream, and nothing a NAT can refuse. What it costs:

**No video.** Pixels are RTP on the media path. Over this they would be base64 inside JSON at the
rate limit below — a snapshot, not a stream — so this transport shows none, and the page says so.

**It is not a teleop lane.** The rendezvous allows 1200 requests per 60 s per peer, and going over
earns a `429` on everything that token does. The robot's lane budgets its own notifications for
that reason (`NOTIFICATIONS_PER_WINDOW`); this side simply does not stream, and a click is four
calls.

**The peer is bound by the stream.** `POST /send` before `GET /events` is a 400 — identity comes
from the bearer token and the stream is what binds it — so the stream opens first and everything
else follows the `welcome`. Which is the same order `mediad::relay` uses on the robot's side, for
the same reason.

**And `startSession`'s answer is in the POST body**, not on the stream, which is the one shape a
reader of this protocol gets wrong once. `list` is the same. Everything else arrives on the stream.
