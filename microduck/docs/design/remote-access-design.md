# Remote access — an account, and a rendezvous behind it

Status: draft · Date: 2026-09-02 · Owner: pierre

How a duck is reached from outside the LAN. [`remote-webrtc.md`](remote-webrtc.md) §7 states the
shape — a bridge from a rendezvous service to the signalling server already running on the robot —
and it is right about the shape. This page owns the two things that shape needs and does not have:
a **credential that names an account**, and a **service to present it to**.

**Built so far** (2026-09-02): §2 — the account. `account.login`, `account.status` and
`account.logout` are served by `updaterd` and reachable locally, over BLE and over a WebRTC
datachannel; `robotctl account login` prints a code and waits, `duckctl account login` prints one
and hangs up. The credential lands in `/etc/robot/hf-token` and renews itself. Nothing consumes it
yet — that is §3, and it is the next slice.

What is **established** about the services this depends on, by probing them rather than by reading
about them:

- **Hugging Face implements the OAuth device grant**, and `huggingface_hub` ships a **first-party
  public client** for it (`DEVICE_CODE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`), so this needs no OAuth app registered
  anywhere. §2.3.
- **A token lasts 30 days**, comes with a refresh token, and **that refresh token rotates on every
  refresh**. §2.7 is what that costs.
- **The token carries every scope Hugging Face grants** — `write-repos`, `manage-repos`, `jobs`,
  `read-billing` — because the first-party client takes no `scope` parameter. §2.4, and it is the
  one thing here that should change before a duck ships.
- **`/oauth/userinfo` answers with the identity in one round trip**, so nothing decodes a JWT.
- **The rendezvous is ours**, and it is `pollen-robotics/reachy_mini_central` — a FastAPI app in
  a Space, readable and changeable by us. Everything §3 and §4 say about it below is read off that
  server rather than inferred from a client.
- **Its wire is not the gst signalling protocol on a WebSocket.** It is the same JSON envelopes
  over **HTTP** — SSE inbound, `POST` outbound, `Authorization: Bearer` — with per-hop peer and
  session ids. This corrects a claim in `remote-webrtc.md` §7; §3.2 says what it costs.

## 1. What has to be true for a duck to be reachable

Four things, and the robot has none of them:

1. a credential that names an account the robot belongs to (§2);
2. a service the robot reaches **outward**, which shows a robot only to its owner (§4);
3. a bridge from that service to `ws://127.0.0.1:8443` (§3);
4. a client that speaks the service's wire, served from somewhere the client can reach (§5).

Plus NAT traversal, which is a property of the media path rather than of any of the above (§6).

One invariant constrains all four, and it is not negotiable here: **local mode must not come to
depend on any of it.** `architecture.md`'s first invariant is that local recovery stays independent,
and `remote-webrtc.md` §7 extends it to media — if the service is down, a LAN client still connects.
Every choice below that could have been made more simply by routing local sessions through the
service too was made the other way for this reason, and §3.1 is where it costs something.

## 2. The account is an OAuth device flow against Hugging Face

**The flow lives in [`hf-robot-account`](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/hf-robot-account)**,
its own repository, because nothing in it is about a duck: any robot with no browser signs in the
same way. What stays in `updater/src/account.rs` is what is a fact about *this* robot — the token
path, the `robot` group, the mapping onto `proto`, and which JSON-RPC code each refusal deserves.
Everything below about the flow itself describes that crate; everything about where the credential
lands and who may read it describes this repository.

### 2.1 Why the device grant, which is also where `reachy_mini` ended up

`reachy_mini` has **both**. It started with authorization code + PKCE, pointing the redirect URI
back at the robot's own HTTP server — `http://reachy-mini.local:8000/api/hf-auth/oauth/callback`,
or `localhost` for the tethered variant — and added a device-code flow later, described in its own
source as "refresh-capable, redirect-free login", which is what its mobile app's setup wizard uses
now. Its reasons are the two below. Worth knowing that this is not a difference of opinion: it is
the same conclusion reached twice, from different directions.

Three costs come with the redirect flow:

- **A registered redirect URI per hostname.** The app has exactly one, which is why the mobile app
  carries a loopback HTTP bridge that catches HF's callback on `127.0.0.1:8000` and rewrites it as a
  302 onto a custom `reachymini://` scheme — a whole component whose stated purpose is avoiding an
  HF-side config change (`features/auth/oauthLoopback.ts`).
- **The browser must be able to resolve and reach the robot.** The callback is a URL *on the robot*.
  So logging in requires being on the robot's network, with mDNS working, which is the same class of
  problem `webrtc-console.md` §2 spends a section on for a page.
- **It is a browser flow on a device with no browser.** The robot is not the party that authenticates;
  it merely hosts the landing pad.

The device grant inverts that: the robot asks HF for a code, says *"open hf.co/oauth/device and type
M8HJ-FMGN"*, and polls until somebody has. No redirect URI, no hostname, no requirement that the
authorising device can reach the robot at all — a phone on cellular is fine. It is the flow specified
for a device with no browser and no keyboard, which is what a duck is. It is also the only one of the
two that yields a **refresh token**, which is what keeps a robot reachable past its first month
(§2.7).

The cost, stated plainly: somebody types eight characters. That is the whole of it, and it is smaller
than the mDNS dependency it removes.

**Three invariants inherited from `reachy_mini`'s wizard**, none of which is about Python and all of
which were learned the expensive way:

- **Lead with the code. Whether to open a browser is a property of the surface, not a rule.** The
  mini's app learned that auto-switching to Safari hid the code before anyone could read it — but
  that is a *phone*: the browser replaces the only screen and backgrounds the app, so the code is
  gone. A terminal keeps it in the scrollback, and the same reasoning gives three different
  answers here:

  - `robotctl account login` opens nothing, because it runs **on the robot**, which has no
    display. It prints the code and waits.
  - `duckctl account login` prints the code and *then* opens the page, because it runs on your
    own machine — where `duckctl open` already launches a browser. `--no-open` suppresses it, and
    so does stderr not being a terminal, because a script that opens a browser window on whoever
    runs it is a surprise. A browser that will not launch is a warning appended to the code, never
    an error replacing it.
  - A phone app keeps the mini's rule as written, for the mini's reason.

  **What opening buys is the navigation, not the typing.** An earlier version of this section
  claimed the robot could hand over a URL with the code in it, on the strength of a note in the
  mini's setup docs saying `huggingface_hub` synthesises a `?user_code=` form. It does not — it
  falls back to `verification_uri` unchanged — and HF's device page ignores the parameter, which a
  browser confirmed after this shipped. `verification_uri_complete` is therefore the plain page
  today, and stays in the reply only because a server that starts sending a real one is then used
  without a wire change.
- **The client going away mid-flow is expected, not an error.** Opening the HF page backgrounds a
  phone app, and iOS then tears the GATT link down. By that point the transport has done its job:
  the daemon is polling and the client comes back to `status`. This is why `login` answers with a
  code rather than a token, and it is the property `robotctl`'s wait loop is careful to not be
  load-bearing for.
- **Appearing on the rendezvous is the only real success signal.** A stored token means the *login*
  worked, not that the robot is reachable — their wizard treats "a robot with my hardware id is in
  the listing" as done and everything else as recoverable. §3 has to make that check available
  here, and `account.status` reporting relay state is where it will go.

### 2.2 The flow, and the transcript it was built from

```
POST https://huggingface.co/oauth/device
     client_id=26be6b09-91c5-47da-9861-d2d2bb7a7e36

  → {"device_code":"41ad39ae-…","user_code":"A6MY-0314",
     "verification_uri":"https://hf.co/oauth/device","expires_in":300}

POST https://huggingface.co/oauth/token
     grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code
     &client_id=26be6b09-…&device_code=41ad39ae-…

  → HTTP 400 {"error":"authorization_pending"}      until somebody approves it
  → {"access_token":"…","refresh_token":"…","expires_in":2591999,
     "token_type":"bearer","id_token":"…","scope":"manage-repos write-repos …"}

GET  https://huggingface.co/oauth/userinfo   Authorization: Bearer <access token>
  → {"name":"Rouanet","preferred_username":"PierreRouanet","orgs":[…], …}
```

No `scope` is sent, because the first-party client does not take one (§2.4). Five things this
answers, each of which is a decision nobody has to make now:

- **No `verification_uri_complete`, and no way to synthesise one.** There is no URL that carries
  the code — HF's device page ignores `?user_code=` — so the code has to be *read by a person*,
  which makes displaying it the **client's** job rather than the daemon's. The field is passed
  through as the plain `verification_uri` so that a server which later sends a real one needs no
  change here.
- **No `interval`.** RFC 8628's five seconds applies, and `slow_down` adds five more.
- **`expires_in: 300`** on the *code*. Five minutes: long enough not to hurry, short enough that a
  client should show what is left, which is why `account.status` counts it down rather than
  repeating the original number.
- **`expires_in: 2591999`** on the *token*, with a `refresh_token`. §2.7.
- **`/oauth/userinfo` gives the identity in one round trip** — `preferred_username` is the handle
  and `name` is a display name that can be anything, so the handle is what is stored and shown.
  The alternative was decoding the `id_token`, which is a JWT parser and a JWKS fetch for the same
  string.

  **It is the last call and the least important one, so it cannot be allowed to fail the login.**
  By the time it runs, somebody has typed a code into a phone; discarding the token because a
  proxy answered 502 would make them do the whole flow again for a label. So the record is stored
  with no name, `account.status` answers `unknown` rather than "signed out", and the next
  `maintain` pass fills it in — the network that failed is the one this board is expected to have.

**One login at a time, and the guard covers the round trip rather than the check before it.** Two
callers arriving together — a console page and a phone, which is a normal thing to happen during
setup — would otherwise both be handed a code, and the store would keep whichever approval landed
last while somebody read the other code and watched it do nothing. The second caller gets
`BUSY` while the first is in flight — with its own message, because "another update is already in
progress" is what `BUSY` says elsewhere and it would send that person looking in the wrong place.
`account.status` carries the code, so a client that lost track of one rejoins it rather than
starting another.

**A refusal has to name a way through it, and `force` is that way here too.** A code nobody is
going to approve — the usual case, somebody started a login and walked off — otherwise holds the
robot for five minutes, and the only remedy was `logout`, which destroys a working credential to
clear a pending one. `force` already means "replace what this robot belongs to"; replacing an
*attempt* at it is the same permission in a smaller size.

**What that costs is that an abandoned flow is still holding a live device code**, and Hugging
Face will approve it if somebody gets round to it. The flow lives in a task that outlives the call
which started it, so this is equally true of `logout`: sign a robot out with a code in the air and
an approval a minute later would sign it back in on its own. Each flow therefore carries the
generation it was started with and checks that it is still the current one — before the store is
touched and again after, because the write awaits — so a superseded login keeps its code and
drops its answer. That is also what makes `logout` able to promise what it says.

### 2.3 The OAuth client is Hugging Face's own — **closed**

`huggingface_hub` ships a **first-party public device-code client**, `DEVICE_CODE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
= `26be6b09-91c5-47da-9861-d2d2bb7a7e36`, which is what `hf auth login` uses. It is public — no
secret, so nothing needs baking into a release beyond a public identifier — and it needs no OAuth
app registered anywhere. `hf_robot_account::HUGGINGFACE_CLIENT_ID` is that constant, and it is the
whole of what this decision came to.

Two alternatives, recorded because the first one looks obvious and is blocked:

- **`reachy_mini`'s own app** (`71146982-…`) is a **confidential** client, so the device endpoint
  refuses it — *"if you want to use the device code flow without client secret authentication,
  delete the secret from the oauth app to make it public"*. Baking that secret into every duck
  makes it not a secret, and making the app public would change the mini's posture to suit us.
- **Dynamic registration.** `POST /oauth/register` is unauthenticated and honours
  `token_endpoint_auth_method: "none"`, so a robot could mint its own public client at first login.
  It works. Pointless now, and a client per robot would be a fleet of identities nobody can
  enumerate or revoke.

### 2.4 The scopes are not ours to choose, and that is the thing to fix before shipping

The first-party client takes **no `scope` parameter**, and the token it issues carries everything
Hugging Face grants:

```
manage-repos write-repos read-repos gated-repos contribute-repos write-collections
read-collections openid write-discussions inference-api jobs webhooks read-billing read-mcp
```

A duck therefore holds a credential that can **push to its owner's repositories, start Jobs and
read their billing** — for something whose entire purpose is proving an identity to a rendezvous
service. Every Reachy Mini in the field is in the same position; that is context, not a defence.

What the account actually needs is `openid profile`, plus `read-repos` for one real thing:
`policy.install` reaching a **private** policy repo from the same token file, with no new
mechanism (`policy-channel-design.md` §7).

**So the narrow version is a Pollen-owned public device-code client with
`openid profile read-repos`** — one `Config::client_id` and one click by somebody with HF org
admin. It is not blocking: the flow works today and a scope change is a re-login. It is worth
doing before a duck goes home with anybody, because the failure mode is asymmetric — a robot that
has been able to write all along cannot be un-done, while a robot that needs a wider scope later
just asks for one.

### 2.5 Where the token lives, and who writes it

`/etc/robot/hf-token`, `root:robot`, `0640`. JSON: the access token, the refresh token, an
absolute `expires_at` (the response gives a duration, and a duration means nothing after a reboot)
and the username, so `account.status` answers with no network at all — a robot that is offline
still knows who it belongs to.

**Written `0600` and relaxed to `0640` after the group is set**, rather than through
`fsutil::write_atomic` like everything else this daemon writes. That helper does not set a mode,
and a token that lands `0644` and is chmodded a moment later is world-readable for that moment —
the kind of window that is invisible in testing and permanent in a `ps`-and-`cat` afterwards.
`account::write_private` is the same rename dance with the temp file opened `0600` from the start,
and a test asserts the landed file gives "others" nothing. On a board with no `robot` group — a
developer's laptop, a half-provisioned board — it stays root-only and says so once, rather than
guessing.

**Not in `robotd.toml`.** Every mechanism that exists for that file is wrong for a secret:
`robotctl configure --list` prints what a robot changes, `policy-channel-design.md`'s full-screen
editor shows the file, and "what has been changed on this robot" is a report we now generate. A
bearer token would be in all three outputs. Its own file, with its own mode, is the whole of the
protection it gets — and §7 says why that is enough.

**`updaterd` owns it.** It already has the HTTP client, already reaches the network on the robot's
behalf, already runs as `root`, and already has a namespace of calls that write system state
(`policy.*`). `configd` owns *config*, has no HTTP client, and adding outward network egress to the
daemon that answers `system.info` would be a new kind of thing for it. `mediad` must not own it: it
runs as `User=mediad` under `ProtectHome=yes`, and it is the process a remote peer talks to.

**`mediad` will read it** — on each connect attempt, plus a slow poll (30 s) while it has none,
which is also its `waiting for token` state. Not built: nothing consumes the credential until §3
exists. No cross-daemon notification: `reachy_mini` has a
`notify_token_change` call from its auth router into its relay, and re-reading the file on the
reconnect that is going to happen anyway makes it unnecessary. The cost is that a fresh login takes
up to a poll interval to become a live producer, which nobody can perceive.

### 2.6 The calls, and which transports may reach them

`account.login`, `account.status` and `account.logout`, on `updaterd` — for `policy.*`'s reasons
exactly: it is the daemon with a network stack, `robotctl` must not link one (it is on the
recovery path), and the credential it stores is also what would reach a private Hub repo, which is
already this daemon's job. `configd` owns *config*, not credentials, and has no HTTP client.
`mediad` must not own it: it runs unprivileged under `ProtectHome=yes`, and it is the process a
remote peer talks to.

**`login` answers with a code and hands the waiting to the daemon.** There is no progress
notification and no long-held connection; a client polls `status`. That is not a simplification,
it is the requirement — see §2.1's second invariant.

**All three are routed to all three transports**: local, BLE and a WebRTC datachannel. BLE matters
most and is the easy call — it is the only transport that reaches a robot fresh out of a box,
which has no network, hence no console and no LAN to open one from, and it is where a setup wizard
already lives. Locally it is `robotctl`, which is how a developer does anything.

**WebRTC is the one worth arguing about, and it is worth writing down rather than assuming.** The
console is the obvious place to put a "sign in" button — a page with the robot already on screen
— and the alternative is ssh or a phone. Against that: this is the one call on that transport
whose effect is **durable in a way nothing else there is**. Everything else a LAN peer may do is
bounded by the session; `account.login` converts *having been on the wifi once* into remote access
that outlives being there. §4 of `remote-webrtc.md` accepts that anyone on the network has the
robot and its camera. It did not consider anyone on the network having them from another continent
next month.

Three things make that acceptable rather than merely permitted:

- **A robot that already belongs to somebody refuses.** `account.login` without `force` answers
  `INVALID_PARAMS` naming the account, so a LAN peer cannot silently take a robot from its owner —
  it has to say so, and a well-behaved client has to ask a person first.
- **It is visible.** `account.status` names the account, from any transport, with no
  authorisation at all. "Which account does this robot belong to" is a question anybody can ask.
- **It is revocable** — `account.logout` from anywhere, and revoking the grant on Hugging Face,
  which no robot-side gate could offer.

  Exact about the first one, because it has two halves and only one of them is `updaterd`'s.
  `logout` deletes the credential, and the relay notices within one heartbeat — ten seconds — and
  drops its connection, which on this service evicts the producer at once. So a robot signed out
  stops being listed and stops being reachable. What it does **not** do is revoke anything:
  **`logout` deletes the robot's copy and tells Hugging Face nothing.** The robot stops being a producer, which is the effect
  somebody signing out is after — but the access token it held stays valid at Hugging Face until
  it expires, up to thirty days, for anything that already read the file. The credential is
  `0640 root:robot`, so "anything" means root or `mediad` on that board; a stolen board is the
  case that matters, and for that the answer is the account's connected-apps page on hf.co, not a
  call here. Sending a revocation from the robot is a candidate for §9 and deliberately not in
  this slice: it needs the endpoint checked against the first-party client rather than assumed,
  and a `logout` that failed because the network was down must still forget the token locally.

**One consequence that lives in another file, and it found a bug.** `account.login` and
`account.logout` are `Call::is_mutating`, which is what `updaterd` authorises against a peer's
uid, so `mediad` had to be added to `allow_users` in `deploy/updater.toml` alongside `btd`.

**Be exact about what that grants, because it is more than the account.** `allow_users` is a
gate on the *caller*, not on the method: `updaterd` now performs any mutating call `mediad` makes,
`update.apply` included. What stops a remote peer applying an update is `mediad`'s own route
table, which refuses to relay it — so that table is not one narrowing among several, it is the
only one, on the process most exposed to a stranger's traffic. `btd` has had exactly this shape
since BLE could apply an update, and the same answer: the boundary is a named list with a test,
`mediad::route`'s `only_these_mutating_calls_are_reachable_over_webrtc`, so routing a new mutating
method has to change that list on purpose and say why. A per-method gate in `updaterd` is what
would make it two layers rather than one; it is not built, and this is the note that says the
choice was made rather than missed.

Writing it down immediately turned up two methods nobody had noticed were broken:
**`policy.install` and `policy.fetch` were routed to WebRTC while `mediad` was not in
`allow_users`**, so `updaterd` answered them `PERMISSION_DENIED` — the console could offer a Hub
browser whose install button could not work. The `allow_users` line added here for the account
fixes them too. That is the argument for a named list over a counted one: the list is where a
transport's authority and a config file's grants are forced to agree out loud.

### 2.7 The token expires in 30 days, and the refresh token rotates — **closed**

A device-code token comes back as `expires_in: 2591999` — thirty days — with a `refresh_token`,
and refreshing **rotates** it: the answer carries a *new* refresh token and the old one is spent.
So the store is two strings plus a clock, and there are three consequences worth naming.

**A robot that is simply left on must renew itself.** `hf_robot_account::maintain` wakes every six
hours and refreshes anything with under a week left — three-quarters of the way through the
token's life, leaving a week of retries for a board whose network is marginal. It is spawned
unconditionally, unlike the update scheduler, because a robot with update checks switched off
still has an account that stops working after a month.

**Rotation leaves one window that cannot be closed.** Between "Hugging Face issued a new pair" and
"the new pair is on disk", the old refresh token is already dead. A power cut in that window
leaves a robot holding a credential HF will not renew. No write ordering fixes it — the rotation
happened on their side — so it is handled rather than prevented: the write is atomic (a reader
sees the old pair or the new one, never half of one), the failure surfaces in
`account.status`'s `last_error`, and the fix is signing in again. Renewing a week early is what
makes that a nuisance rather than an outage.

**A robot switched off for more than thirty days comes back needing a login**, and no margin can
save it. `account.token_expires_in` goes negative, which is how a client says so rather than
leaving somebody to discover it when the robot fails to appear.

## 3. The bridge

### 3.1 A listener on loopback, not a signaller inside `webrtcsink`

`webrtcsink` takes a custom signaller (the `Signallable` interface), so the temptation is to implement
one that speaks the rendezvous wire directly: one hop fewer, no id translation, no local WebSocket
client. **Rejected**, for a reason that is structural rather than aesthetic: one `webrtcsink` has one
signaller. Pointing it at the service means local sessions go through the service too — which breaks
§1's invariant — and keeping both means a second `webrtcsink` off the tee, which means encoding the
same frames twice on a board where the encoder is the budget.

So the bridge is what `remote-webrtc.md` §7 describes, and what `reachy_mini` runs:

```
  rendezvous  ──SSE──►  relay task  ──ws──►  127.0.0.1:8443  ◄──ws──  webrtcsink
  (HTTP)      ◄─POST──  (in mediad)  ◄──ws──  signalling server      (the producer)
```

The relay registers with the service as a **`producer`** and with the local server as a
**`listener`** — the roles are inverted on the two sides, because to the service it *is* the robot and
to the pipeline it is a peer asking for a session.

### 3.2 What it translates, and the correction to §7

§7 says "the bridge parses nothing. It proxies the gst signalling protocol, which is the same protocol
a LAN client speaks." The payloads — SDP and ICE — are indeed opaque and stay that way. The envelope
is not, in three ways:

| | local side | rendezvous side |
|---|---|---|
| transport | WebSocket | SSE inbound, `POST /send` outbound |
| auth | none (§4 of `remote-webrtc.md`) | `Authorization: Bearer <hf token>` |
| ids | its own `peerId`, its own `sessionId` | different ones, per hop |
| our role | `listener` | `producer` |
| where a reply arrives | on the socket, always | **`sessionStarted` and `list` in the `POST` response body**; everything else on the stream |

That last row cost an afternoon and belongs in a table rather than in somebody's memory. On a
WebSocket every answer comes back on the socket, so a client naturally treats a send as
fire-and-forget. Here `handle_start_session` *returns* `{"type":"sessionStarted","sessionId":…}` to
the caller of `POST /send` — the producer is notified over SSE, the consumer is answered in the
response — and a page that discarded that body got the robot's offer for a session whose id it had
never been told, then failed on a null peer connection. `list` is answered the same way, and is
*also* pushed over the stream after the welcome, which is why the listing half looked healthy while
the session half was broken.

So the bridge keeps a session table both ways and rewrites `sessionId` on every `peer` message. That
is where `reachy_mini`'s relay has needed most of its scar tissue (§3.4), and it is the honest
description: **a translator with an opaque payload**, not a relay. The payoff §7 claims for
`webrtcsink` over `webrtcbin` survives — the protocol still exists rather than being invented, and the
translation is a table rather than a parser — but "proxies, parses nothing" should stop being said.

### 3.3 The lease, and why the heartbeat is not optional

The service evicts a producer that has sent nothing for `LEASE_SECONDS`, whatever its socket looks
like. That is not defensive over-engineering on its part: a half-open TCP connection — wifi yanked,
NAT rebinding, a sleeping captive portal — absorbs server-pushed keepalives silently for minutes,
during which the robot believes it is reachable and is not.

The numbers, from the server rather than from a guess: `PRODUCER_LEASE_SECONDS` is **30**, and
the SSE welcome advertises `recommended_heartbeat_interval_seconds: 10.0`. The lease is keyed
*only* on inbound `POST /send` — a healthy-looking SSE stream refreshes nothing.

So the relay re-emits `setPeerStatus` at the cadence the welcome names, falling back to 5 s and
clamped to [1 s, 60 s] so a misconfigured service can neither ask for a request storm nor talk us
into a cadence slower than our own eviction. `reachy_mini`'s ladder has a middle rung —
`lease_seconds / 3` — for a server that publishes the lease but not the cadence. **This server
publishes no `lease_seconds`**, so that rung is unreachable here; it is not worth reproducing a
negotiation step for a field nothing sends.

**`POST /send` before `GET /events` is a 400, so the order is not a preference.** The peer does
not exist until the stream does — identity comes from the bearer token, and the token is bound to
a peer by the `/events` connection. §3.4 wanted registration before anything reported the robot
reachable for a different reason; the service enforces the same order for its own.

**The rate limit is 1200 requests per 60 s per peer**, sliding. A 10 s heartbeat and a 30 s poll
are nine requests a minute, so it constrains nothing here — it is a ceiling to know about before
somebody shortens an interval to "be safe".

**The SSE side has its own keepalive to size against.** After 30 s with nothing to deliver the
server emits an `event: ping`, whose only job is to stop the HTTP/2 proxy in front of the Space
from killing an idle connection. A read timeout on our side therefore has to be comfortably more
than 30 s — `reachy_mini` uses 60, which is two missed pings, and that is the number to take.

### 3.4 The failure modes are already known, which is the main reason to read their relay

Four, each cheap to build in now and expensive to rediscover:

- **Split-brain.** The SSE stream is healthy and the service no longer lists us — a `setPeerStatus`
  round trip cancelled mid-flight leaves exactly this. Nothing in the connection notices. Their
  answer: poll `/api/robot-status` every 30 s, and force a reconnect after two consecutive misses.
- **Concurrent sessions.** The server does gate this — `handle_start_session` answers
  `sessionRejected` with `reason: "robot_busy"` and the `activeApp` that holds it, and pushes a
  `sessionStateChanged` to the owner's other devices so their UI flips inside the round trip. So
  the robot-side gate is belt-and-braces rather than a workaround, and it should stay: a second
  peer driving the same robot is `remote-webrtc.md` §9's interleaving bug with two remote writers
  instead of a pad and a peer, and that is a bad enough outcome to check twice.
- **Ordering at registration.** Register as a producer *before* reporting `connected`, or every
  observer — a status call, a page, a person — sees "remote access enabled" while the service does not
  yet know the robot exists.
- **Backoff with jitter, capped.** 5 s growing to 60 s, plus ~10%. A fleet reconnecting in lockstep
  after a service restart is a self-inflicted outage.
- **A credential that changed under the connection.** The token is read once per connection, so
  neither a `logout` nor a `login --force` onto another account reaches a running relay by itself
  — it would go on refreshing the lease with a credential its owner deleted. Re-read on the
  heartbeat tick, which makes the lag one cadence, and dropping the stream is the deregistration:
  a clean disconnect evicts the peer immediately, and the sweep is only for sockets that never
  report closing. There is also an explicit `roles: []` withdraw, which is for keeping the channel
  open to re-register later and is not what this wants.
- **A 401 is not a case for backoff.** No number of retries fixes a token the service refuses; a
  login does. So that path waits on the token file at the same 30 s cadence as a robot nobody has
  signed in, rather than posting a doomed request every five seconds into somebody else's Space.

Two more from their source, about what the server does rather than what to do about it. **Only
producers carrying `meta.hardware_id` are swept**, so one without it is never evicted — a crashed
daemon would haunt its owner's robot list until the Space restarted. That turns §3.7's "should"
into a "must". And **a second `/events` on the same token supersedes the connection without
evicting the peer**, so a daemon restarting while its previous socket is half-open reconnects
cleanly — which is what makes a 60 s read timeout safe rather than merely brave.

What we do **not** copy is their `RobotAppLock`: it arbitrates a local *app* against a remote session,
and a duck has no app. `remote-webrtc.md` §9 owns the equivalent question here (a pad and a peer both
writing intents) and defers it deliberately; a second remote peer is the same gap, not a new one.

### 3.5 It is a task in `mediad`, in a module with no GStreamer in it

Not a new unit. A `relayd` would need its own copy of the producer identity, its own config, its own
restart story, and it would still be useless without `mediad` running — three new moving parts to
isolate a task that is a websocket, an HTTP client and a hash map.

It goes where `session.rs` went, and for the same reason: **transport-agnostic on purpose**, so it is
testable on a laptop against a fake service and a fake local server. That is what made the control
channel testable without a board and it is worth twice as much here, because every failure in §3.4 is
a timing failure that no manual test on hardware will reproduce on demand.

One inherited rule: nothing in a GStreamer signal handler may panic (`pipeline.rs`'s header, and the
process abort that taught it). The relay never touches one — but it will want to *reach* the pipeline
eventually, and that is the boundary to keep clean.

### 3.6 What a bridged peer may call: exactly what a LAN peer may

The session is the same `webrtcsink` session and `route.rs` is the same table. This is deliberate and
it is also the part worth re-examining once it works: §4 argues the robot needs no gate because the
service authenticated both ends, and after this page that argument gets *stronger* — a bridged peer
has proved account ownership, where a LAN peer has proved only that it is on the wifi. The robot can
tell them apart by source address (§7 notes it), and nothing yet acts on the difference. Keep it true.

### 3.7 What a duck has to call itself, and it is not free-form after all

`meta` is free-form to the *protocol*, but the server reads two keys out of it, so a duck that
fills it in arbitrarily gets subtly wrong behaviour rather than a clear failure:

- **`hardware_id`** (or `install_id`) is the **stable-identity key**. On `setPeerStatus` the server
  looks for another producer of the *same user* carrying the same value and evicts the older one —
  ending its session if it had one. It exists because a re-flashed daemon, a duplicated SD card or
  a stale tray process would otherwise show up as a second robot forever.

  So a duck **must** put something stable there, and the obvious candidate already exists:
  `producer.rs` reads the SoC serial for the local `meta`, which is exactly "stable per physical
  robot across reinstalls and renames". Leaving the key out means a robot that reconnects with a
  fresh token is listed twice — and, since the sweep keys on this field, never evicted at all;
  putting the *name* there means renaming a robot forks its identity.

  Where there is no serial to read — a developer's laptop, a board whose device tree has none — it
  falls back to `/etc/machine-id`, stable per *install* rather than per robot. Weaker and still
  correct for the purpose: one machine is listed once, and the producer stays sweepable. `sounds`
  already makes exactly this substitution for exactly this reason.
- **`simulated`** is ours rather than the server's, and a key it never reads: a duck in MuJoCo
  registers exactly as a robot does, and a listing that could not tell them apart would end with
  somebody driving a simulation and wondering why the robot on the shelf is still.
  `configd --simulated <serial>` is where the fact is declared, and `docs/design/simulation.md` §8
  is why it is declared only there. That serial is also what makes a simulated duck's `hardware_id`
  work: the `/etc/machine-id` fallback is per *install*, so ducks sharing a machine would evict each
  other, and macOS has no such file at all.
- **`name`** is what the listing shows a person, and the consumer's `name` is what the server
  reports back as `activeApp` to the owner's other devices. `transport` (`"wifi"` / `"usb"`) is a
  mini-ism a duck can leave alone; a `kind` of `microduck` is what lets one client list both
  families without opening a session.

**And one protocol fact with a consequence: peers are keyed by token.** `get_or_create_peer` is
a `token -> peer_id` map, and a second connection on the same token supersedes the first. Two
things sharing a token therefore take turns being reachable, and neither looks broken. Each duck
runs its own device flow, so no two robots share one — images are built from scratch rather than
cloned, so there is no path by which a credential is copied onto a second board.

  Where it does bite is a **consumer**: a cloud backend that authenticates with the *robot's* token
  supersedes the robot's own peer and takes it off the listing. A Space consuming a duck needs its
  own token on the same account, or the visitor's. §5's client uses the visitor's, which is why it
  never meets this.

## 4. The rendezvous is the one `reachy_mini` uses — **decided**

`pollen-robotics-reachy-mini-central.hf.space`, the Space the mini's fleet already registers
with. Decided rather than derived: it costs no backend work, it is proven under real robots, and
the whole of this page becomes a client-side project.

What a robot needs from it is small: `GET /events` (SSE, `Authorization: Bearer <hf token>`),
`POST /send` (same), and `GET /api/robot-status` to ask whether it is still listed. Its `meta` is
free-form, so a duck registers with whatever identifies it — and `producer.rs` already assembles
exactly the fields a listing wants (name, serial, release, `api_version`), which is what
`webrtc-console.md` §5 predicted the rendezvous would need. A `kind` of `microduck` goes in the
same structure, so a client that lists a user's robots can tell a duck from a mini without
opening a session.

**We own it**, which is what makes this reuse rather than a dependency: `pollen-robotics/reachy_mini_central`
is a FastAPI app in a Space, and it can be read and changed on this side. Two things follow:

- **The protocol is a fact, not a guess.** Every number in §3 — the 30 s lease keyed on `POST /send`,
  the 10 s advertised cadence, the 30 s SSE ping, the `sessionRejected` gate, the `hardware_id`
  eviction — is read off `app.py`. An earlier version of this page said the repository was private;
  that was a wrong-name 401 mistaken for a permissions error, and the wire was reverse-read from
  the client for no reason.
- **A duck-shaped need is a pull request, not a fork.** If ducks want a different lease, a `kind`
  filter on the listing, or an eviction rule that does not assume one robot per token, those are
  changes to a server we maintain. Which also means the reverse: a change made there for the mini
  can break ducks, and after this page there is a second family of robots on it.

The one thing that does not transfer is its **lock model** — `RobotAppLock`, local app versus
remote session, which the mini's relay gates incoming sessions on. A duck has no app, so §3.4
takes the reconnect behaviour and leaves that part.

## 5. The client is a Space with a Hugging Face sign-in — **decided**

The console is `include_str!`'d into `mediad` and served by the robot (`webrtc-console.md` §1),
which works because the client is on the LAN. **A remote client cannot fetch a page from a robot it
cannot reach**, so remote needs the page hosted off-robot *and* a second signalling transport in
it.

**Decided: a Space in the `pollen-robotics` org with `hf_oauth: true`** — `microduck-console` —
serving the same page the robot serves, with the transport chosen by how it was opened. And the
deciding argument is not hosting, it is the **token**.

A remote consumer authenticates to the rendezvous exactly as the robot does — a bearer token the
service resolves through `whoami-v2`, reading `name` out of the answer. It performs no token-type
check and no scope check, so a browser's OAuth token is accepted on the same footing as the
robot's device-flow one. Which makes the whole question "where does a page get an HF token", and a
Space answers it: `hf_oauth: true` in the README creates the OAuth app and registers a redirect URI
targeting the Space, and `@huggingface/hub`'s `oauthLoginUrl` / `oauthHandleRedirectIfPresent` do
the rest of the flow **client-side**, PKCE, with no secret in the page.

### 5.0 It is a Docker Space, and that cost an afternoon

There are two documented ways for a Space to hand its page that client id, and the tidy one did
not work. A **static** Space is supposed to inject `window.huggingface.variables.OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
— `huggingface.js` reads exactly that (`oauth-login-url.ts`), `reachy_mini_website` reads exactly
that, and HF ships `huggingfacejs/client-side-oauth` as the example. On `microduck-console` it
never appeared: not after a metadata change, not after the Space went public, not after a
delete-and-recreate, and not after the page was given a real `<html><head>` for an injector to
work on — a page that had been a bare doctype for its whole life until then. Hugging Face's own
API reported our Space and a working one as indistinguishable: both `sdk: static`, both public,
both `hf_oauth: true`, both `RUNNING`.

So the console is a **Docker** Space: `hf_oauth: true` puts `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` in the container's
environment — the documented path for anything that is not static, and the one the `grabette-*`
Spaces use — and eight lines of `sh` substitute it into the page as it is served. A page that
needs no server has one, for that reason and no other. `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` is in the same
environment and never goes near the page.

Two things that came out of chasing it are worth keeping. The page **logs its own build stamp**
(revision plus a hash of the page), because a static host caches and a browser caches harder, and
an hour went into a fix that was never being loaded. And every step of the sign-in **races a
timeout**: a spent `?code=` left in the address bar leaves `oauthHandleRedirectIfPresent` pending
forever, and everything a page would say about that is on the far side of the `await`.

GitHub Pages, which an earlier draft of this section preferred, loses on the same point: the page
would need an OAuth app registered by hand and its own redirect URI, maintained by us, to arrive
where a line of README metadata arrives. It stays possible — the page takes a client id from
`?client_id=` as well, which is how one is tried before it is written down — and this is the same
reasoning §2.3 used for taking Hugging Face's own device-code client rather than registering one.

**We ask for no scopes beyond the defaults.** `openid profile` is always included and is all this
needs — the token's whole job is proving an identity to the rendezvous, which is the argument §2.4
makes about the robot's own credential, and it would be a poor look to fix it on the robot while
handing a browser `write-repos`.

**Not a route in `reachy_mini_central`.** One host and one deploy, at the cost of putting duck UI
inside the service the mini fleet depends on. §4's "we maintain it, so a duck-shaped need is a pull
request" cuts both ways: the reverse of that is that our page becomes their operational risk.

**The page's source lives in this repository**, next to the one the robot serves, because it has to
track two things that live here — the signalling protocol and this project's own method names — and
a copy in a Space repo would drift from both. It **is** the one the robot serves:
`mediad/webclient/index.html`, one file, with the transport decided by whether its
`{{SIGNALLING_PORT}}` token was substituted. `web.rs` substitutes it and a test asserts the served
page has none left; the Space copy keeps it, which is how the page knows no robot served it.

The Space is a deploy target — `pollen-robotics/microduck-console` — and
`scripts/publish-console.sh` is what puts a page there, along with the `Dockerfile` and
`entrypoint.sh` that serve it. It substitutes the API version from `duck-ipc-proto`, stamps the
build, and refuses to publish a page that has lost either the port token (which would make the
Space's copy try to open a WebSocket) or the client-id token (which would leave it unable to sign
anybody in). By hand while there is one Space; by CI when that stops being true.

One thing settled rather than preferred, and it survives from the earlier draft: `EventSource`
**cannot set headers**, so a browser speaking the SSE wire must either put the token in the query
string or read the stream with `fetch` and split SSE by hand. `reachy-mini-js` does the former and
**the server is removing it** — `_resolve_hf_token` accepts `?token=` as a transitional fallback,
logs a deprecation per client IP, and says in its own docstring that the query form goes once the
known clients ship the header. A bearer token in a query string is a bearer token in the Space's
access log and in every proxy between. So the page is `fetch` plus a few lines of line-splitting,
written that way once.

What the page is, then, is the mirror of `mediad::relay`: SSE in, `POST /send` out, gst signalling
envelopes with per-hop ids, and an opaque SDP/ICE payload — the same translation in the other
direction, which is why §3.2's table is worth reading before writing it.

### 5.1 A duck in a mini's client, which is a conversation rather than a commit

Putting ducks into a rendezvous whose other clients are `reachy_mini_mobile_app` and its desktop
counterpart means a duck can appear in somebody's mini app — and be driven as a mini, with method
names this project does not serve. Video would arrive; nothing else would, and the failure would
read as a broken robot.

`meta.kind` is there so a client can tell the families apart (§3.7), and this page filters on it.
The mini's clients cannot be made to, from here: that is a conversation with whoever owns them, and
it is the direction §4 did not consider — not "what does a duck need from the service" but "what
does a duck arriving in the service do to its existing clients".

**A non-browser consumer works today, and its one snag is the channel label.**
`ReachyCentralConsumer` — their aiortc client — connects to a duck through the rendezvous and
decodes frames with nothing added on either side: `pip install "reachy_mini[central-consumer]"`,
`robot_name="olducky"`, and `latest_frame()` returns `(720, 1280, 3) uint8`. Verified. What it says
on the way past is `ignoring unexpected data channel: 'control'`, because it looks for the label
the mini's daemon opens and ours is `control` (`remote-webrtc.md` §5). Nothing for a perception
consumer, which wants pixels — and the first thing to fix for one that wants to *drive* a duck,
where the label is the smaller half of the problem and the method names are the larger. §5.2 is
both halves, on this side.

**Two of their clients select on `meta.name` and neither reads `kind`.** The host shell's picker
lists whatever is online, and `ReachyCentralConsumer` matches `robot_name` against `meta.name` with
a **fallback**: one visible producer for the token is used whatever it is called. So a cloud backend
written for a mini, on an account whose only online robot is a duck, picks the duck and drives it
with method names this project does not serve. That is worth telling them before somebody meets it,
and it is a two-line change on their side — `kind` is already on the wire.

### 5.2 A consumer that drives a duck, and the one line of theirs it has to get past

`spaces/policy-playground` is the second consumer in this repository and the first that *sends*
anything: sign in, list the account's ducks, and put a policy from the Hub onto one in a click —
`policy.fetch`, `robot.setSkill`, `robot.policies`, `robot.do`, which is `robotctl policy add`'s
own order over a datachannel instead of over a unix socket.

The whole cost of "drive" over "watch" is a label. `ReachyCentralConsumer` handles
`pc.on("datachannel")` with `if channel.label != "data": ignoring unexpected data channel`, and
`mediad` opens `control` (`remote-webrtc.md` §5) — so a consumer that wants pixels needs nothing
and a consumer that wants to send a call gets no channel at all. `RTCPeerConnection` is a pyee
emitter, so `pc.on` *appends* rather than replaces: a subclass overriding `_build_pc` registers a
second listener, theirs still runs and still warns about a label it does not know, and ours takes
the channel it dropped. Nothing in their package is rewritten, which is what makes it survive the
version that fixes their side — the day their handler takes `control`, ours stops being the first
to claim it and the shim becomes a deletion.

Their `send_command` is reused rather than reimplemented, and that is not laziness:
`RTCDataChannel.send` is not thread-safe, they already marshal every send onto the loop that owns
the peer connection, and a Gradio callback runs in whichever worker thread the request landed in.

**Two refusals, and which side owns them is most of what writing this settled.** `policy.fetch`
checks the claims that are about the robot — `obs_len`, `action_len`, `model_api`, `robot.model` —
and it checks them *before* the download, so a client should not repeat them and should show what
the robot said. `robot.setSkill` checks nothing about the command encoding: a phase policy
installed as a one-shot is **accepted**, and the robot then feeds a constant to a network trained
on a phase, which is plausible movement and wrong movement. That rule lives in `robotctl`, and
`robotctl` is not in the path of a click — so `catalogue.refusal` is the same rule written a second
time, and any client that grows this button needs it a third.

**A `401` from the rendezvous is the token and nothing else, and proving that took reading their
`app.py` after guessing wrong.** The first version of this page listed robots with `GET
/api/robot-status`, got a `401`, and concluded the endpoint must require an established peer —
plausible, because `POST /send` does (§3.1's note) and because the robot only ever polls it while
holding a stream. It does not: the route is `Depends(_resolve_hf_token)` and then
`validate_hf_token`, which is one `whoami-v2` call with no scope check, no token-type check and no
peer requirement, filtered to `p.username == username`. Its own docstring says it exists for
exactly this — "a passive status indicator without consuming a session slot".

Which makes it the *better* call than the console's `list`, for a reason §3.7 already stated: peers
are keyed by token, so the `/events` stream a browser opens to list would supersede the one a
session is riding on. A page listing that way cannot refresh its list without dropping its own
session. `/api/robot-status` opens nothing.

The `401` was **Gradio's mocked sign-in**. Outside a Space — `SPACE_ID` unset —
`gr.LoginButton` behaves, the profile is real, and `_get_mocked_oauth_info` sets `access_token` to
the literal string `mock-oauth-token-for-local-dev`. A service that resolves tokens through
`whoami-v2` refuses that, correctly, and the symptom is a page saying "sign in again" beside a
console listing the same duck. So a local run has to prefer `HF_TOKEN` or what `hf auth login`
stored, and the mock is recognised by value rather than by an `SPACE_ID` check — a real token that
arrives outside a Space is still a real token.

**And the general lesson, which is why the page now logs everything to two places at once.** Four
layers meet in one button — a token, a rendezvous, a candidate pair, a robot's own refusal — and
all four fail as "nothing happened". Every HTTP status, every signalling frame, every JSON-RPC
line and every refusal is logged, with the token's *source* named and the token never written
down; `DUCK_LOG=DEBUG` adds the streaming notifications and the per-candidate ICE lines. The panel
is on the page as well as the terminal because a Space has logs nobody has open and a browser has
no stderr. Each layer is also runnable alone — `uv run rendezvous.py`, `uv run catalogue.py`,
`uv run lan.py` — which is what turns "it does not work" into a line number without a
conversation.

`IntentResult` is the other thing a client gets wrong once: `robot.setSkill`, `robot.do`,
`robot.init` and `robot.relax` answer `accepted: false` with a reason rather than a JSON-RPC
error, deliberately — safety refusing to run a policy on a fallen robot is not a broken call. A
page that only catches errors reports every one of those as a success and leaves a motionless
robot unexplained.

**And the transport is what this leans on hardest from a Space.** The control channel is SCTP over
the same candidate pair as the media, so a relay that is not there takes the click with it: from a
data centre the session negotiates and may then carry nothing. §6's endpoint answers now, so the
ordinary case is covered — but a metered dependency is still a dependency, which is why the status
line names the stage it reached rather than saying "connecting…", and why the page has a second
way in.

**`lan.py` is that second way, and it is a transport rather than a second design.** The robot is
already serving `webrtcsink`'s signalling server at `ws://<robot>:8443` — the one the console
talks to — and it carries the same gst envelopes the rendezvous carries over SSE and `POST /send`.
So one hop is swapped and nothing above it changes: the same `control` channel, the same JSON-RPC,
the same buttons, and the page holds either consumer without asking which. §3.2's table is the
whole of the difference, and swapping in the direction of the LAN removes rather than adds — no
account, no lease, no rendezvous, no relay, host candidates on both sides.

Which turns out to be worth more than a workaround for a dead DNS record, and it is the argument
for keeping it after §6 is fixed: **it separates the transport from everything else.** A click
that works on the LAN and not through the rendezvous has told you which layer to look at, and
that answer was previously a guess.

Its one cost is that it is hand-written where the rendezvous half was inherited: a dozen envelope
shapes read off `net/webrtc/protocol` and the console page, and getting one wrong produces silence
rather than an error. So `uv run lan.py` stands up a producer on loopback that speaks the same
protocol and drives a real session against it — welcome, list, `startSession`, an offer answered,
DTLS, SCTP, the channel, a call matched to its reply. Two aiortc peers on `127.0.0.1` are not a
duck; they are the same protocol, which is the part that fails quietly.

### 5.3 Frames out of the robot, which is what §6 was blocking

The goal §5.2's Space was a step towards is a Space **processing this camera on Hugging Face
hardware**, and that is the one thing the control lane cannot carry: pixels are what a media path
is for. Pulling them means WebRTC, WebRTC across two NATs means a relay candidate, and §6 says
there is not one. `vision-demo` had "signalling worked and media did not" as its documented
expected outcome for exactly this reason.

**So the robot dials the Space and pushes.** `media.stream {url}` — answered by `mediad` itself,
like `media.video`, because the pipeline is `mediad`'s and no service owns it — tells the robot a
`wss://` to connect to; it opens it outward and sends frames. An outbound WebSocket is the one
thing that always works, and the robot is already proving it every second it is reachable at all.
No relay, no ICE, and **the rendezvous carries an instruction rather than payload**, which is the
property that makes this scale where relaying pixels through a service the mini fleet depends on
would not.

    Space ──media.stream {url}──► rendezvous ──► robot
    robot ═══════ H.264, outbound wss, direct ═══════► Space

**H.264 rather than JPEG, and it was JPEG first.** The board has a hardware encoder, so the encode
costs the VPU rather than a core, and prediction is worth an order of magnitude of bytes — 0.5 KB
an access unit against JPEG's 6.5 KB a frame on synthetic content, less on real footage and the
same direction. Two things had to be built to make it safe, and both are the kind that fail
invisibly:

- **A receiver that joins mid-stream can decode nothing until a keyframe**, and a Space restarts on
  every push, so reconnecting is the common case rather than the exception. `h264parse
  config-interval=-1` repeats SPS and PPS in front of every keyframe, and opening the valve sends
  an upstream `force-key-unit` so the first thing a receiver gets is decodable.
- **Dropping the oldest and keeping the newest is right for JPEG and wrong here.** A predicted
  frame whose reference was dropped decodes to garbage that looks like a broken camera rather than
  a broken transport. So a gap abandons the stream to the next keyframe, in two places: the
  branch's queue and the sender's channel.

JPEG stays reachable on `media.stream {"encoding": "jpeg"}`, because every frame being independent
is worth having for a receiver that reconnects constantly.

**The branch is valved, not conditional.** `webrtcsink` owns the video track's encoder and is
handed raw video on purpose — pre-encoded input puts the encoder out of reach of its congestion
control, which this pipeline tried and reverted — so there is nothing to tap and this is a *second*
encoder off the same raw tee. On a board where the encoder is the budget that has to cost nothing
when nobody is streaming, so the branch is built once behind a `valve drop=true` and opened by a
property write. Adding and removing elements on a live pipeline was the alternative, and
`pipeline.rs`'s history with a `videoflip` is why nobody should reach for that here.

What this does **not** do is give a browser a picture of a robot, carry audio, or close a teleop
loop. Those want WebRTC and §6 is still what they need; the frame stream is for the case where the
consumer is a program.

## 6. NAT: STUN on both ends, and the robot offers the relay — **decided**

`stun.l.google.com:19302`, which is `webrtcsink`'s own default and now also what the console asks
for when it is remote. That second half was missing and mattered: a page offering only its
`192.168.…` addresses to a robot on another network negotiates a session perfectly and carries
nothing, because there is no candidate pair that can work.

**TURN is not optional and it is not symmetric.** Between a robot behind a home router and a
consumer behind whatever a cloud provider gives a container, srflx-to-srflx needs both NATs to
allow a hole to be punched — often they do, and often enough they do not. A relay always works, at
the cost of somebody's bandwidth, which is why ICE tries it last.

**One relay candidate is enough, and it is not always the robot's.** A connection needs *one*, not
two, and `aiortc`'s STUN client works where its TURN client does not — so a Python consumer cannot
be the side that relays, and the robot has to be. `reachy_mini`'s #1182 established that
arrangement and `mediad::turn` is the same one.

**What that argument left out is whether the two ends can address each other at all**, and an
iPhone on a mobile network is the case where they cannot. It has no IPv4 socket: it reaches a
*hostname* through DNS64/NAT64, the STUN server reports an IPv4 reflexive address back, and the
phone gathers a candidate saying so. But an ICE candidate is a bare literal, and the robot's relay
candidate is a bare IPv4 literal on a board with no global IPv6 at all — which that phone cannot
send a packet to. Measured on olducky: six sessions, `offering relay candidates relays=5` every
time, `Ice connection state … failed` every time, about eight seconds apart.

**That measurement cannot carry the weight it was given, and the phone turned out to have IPv4.**
`relays=5` counted the TURN server URIs `webrtcbin` accepted inside `consumer-added`, before any
allocation had been attempted — not relay candidates gathered. A robot whose allocation fails every
time logs it identically to one whose allocation succeeds, so those six sessions are equally
consistent with the ordinary explanation: no relay candidate on either end. The line is now named
`added TURN servers for this consumer servers=N` for what it counts, and `count_gathered_candidates`
logs the half that was missing, once per consumer when gathering completes:

```
gathered ICE candidates host=2 srflx=1 prflx=0 relay=0 unparsed=0
TURN servers were added and no relay candidate came back …
```

`relay=0` beside a non-zero `servers` is the failure with no other symptom, and the second line
fires only on that pair. Until a robot has produced one of these, the cause above is unconfirmed
and the DNS64/NAT64 paragraph should be read as the hypothesis it was, not a finding.

So **the console offers a relay of its own** (`refreshRelays` in `mediad/webclient/index.html`),
and only its own allocation can bridge this: `turn.cloudflare.com` is a name, so it resolves over
IPv6, and the relayed address Cloudflare hands back is IPv4, which the robot can reach. Confirmed
from the phone before it was written — the same credentials in a Trickle ICE page gathered a
`relay` candidate with an IPv4 address over 4G, where the robot's own candidates paired with
nothing.

The page mints them with **the visitor's** token, not the robot's, which is the right way round
twice over: a robot's allowance should go on being watched rather than on watching, and a browser
signed in with `hf_oauth` already holds a token of its own. A LAN session asks for none — there
are host candidates on both sides and nothing would use a relay.

The credentials are Cloudflare's, minted per account by a proxy Hugging Face hosts and
authenticated with **the same token the relay signs in with** — so a robot that belongs to
somebody can offer a relay and one that belongs to nobody cannot, which is the same line §2 draws
everywhere else. They are short-lived: a task refreshes at half of a 600 s lifetime, and retries
in thirty seconds after a *transient* failure only. A robot nobody
has signed in has nothing to retry for, and a warning every thirty seconds for the life of the
daemon is how a log stops being read.

**Fetching them must never be in the way.** The only caller is GStreamer's `consumer-added`
handler, where the SDP offer for that consumer is not generated until the handler returns, so an
HTTP request there would delay every connection — including the LAN ones that will never use a
relay — by however long the proxy takes to answer. `Relays::uris` therefore reads a cache, never
blocks (a `try_read` that yields nothing rather than waiting) and never fails. An empty answer is
the ordinary state for the first few seconds after boot and forever on a robot with no account,
and it means host and srflx only, which is all anything on the same network needs.

**A duck does gather relay candidates, measured rather than inferred.** On `lavandiere`
(0.12.0-dev.1007.3c8e681, signed in as `PierreRouanet`), a LAN session over `webrtcsink`'s own
signalling server:

```
added TURN servers for this consumer  servers=5
gathered ICE candidates  host=6 srflx=3 prflx=0 relay=6 unparsed=0 complete=false
```

with the six `typ relay` lines on `104.30.…` seen independently at the consumer. So
`add-turn-server` works, `libnice` completes a Cloudflare allocation over the credentials this
account mints, and nothing in the robot's half of §6 is broken. A **LAN** session settles this
because gathering does not depend on the peer: a relay candidate is allocated whether or not
anything will ever pair with it, and only the pairing is remote. That makes it the cheap first
test whenever this question comes up again — no rendezvous, no Space, no second network.

What it does not settle is a session that *fails*. The tally has to be read on the robot that is
failing, during the failure; `relay=6` here means the machinery works, not that every duck's does.

**And a relay carries a real session, end to end.** `lavandiere` on
`0.12.0-dev.1011.cb17b40`, driven from a private HF Space over the rendezvous:

```
ICE connection state  state=Checking → Connected (2.0 s) → Completed (2.2 s)
gathered ICE candidates  host=6 srflx=3 prflx=0 relay=9 unparsed=0 complete=true
selected candidate pair  local=relay 104.30.144.144:29840/udp via 141.101.90.1
                         remote=prflx 54.225.144.144:11854/udp
```

The robot's Cloudflare relay is the local half of the pair that won, so §6's arrangement is not
merely available — it is what carried the video. The consumer offered no TURN credentials of its
own and needed none, which is the property the whole section is built on.

The remote half being **`prflx`** is worth reading too: the robot learned the Space's address from
an inbound STUN check rather than from a signalled candidate, which is the ordinary shape for a
consumer whose srflx is not usable. Nothing had to be done about it.

So a duck that cannot be reached is a duck to take these three lines from, not a design to revisit.
The first thing to check remains the build: a robot older than the endpoint fix holds no
credentials at all and says so every thirty seconds.

**`reachy_mini` main is not a working reference to copy from — it is the same arrangement,
unverified in the same way.** Read against `mediad` at `9d364df`: `webrtc_utils.TurnCredentials`
and `media_server._apply_turn_servers` match `turn.rs` and `offer_relay_candidates` point for
point — the same Space endpoint, the same 600 s TTL refreshed at half, the same 30 s retry after a
transient failure only, the same `stun:`/no-credential entries skipped, the same percent-encoded
`turn://user:pass@host:port`, the same `add-turn-server` inside `consumer-added` before the offer,
the same cached read that never blocks the offer thread. Neither daemon sets `stun-server`, so both
take `webrtcsink`'s default. **And neither observes a candidate**: no `on-ice-candidate` and no
`ice-gathering-state` anywhere in `src/reachy_mini/`, so "the patched daemon offers its own relay"
— `rf-detr-realtime-webcam`'s `app.py` says it while passing STUN-only for the robot leg — rests on
the same `add-turn-server`-returned-cleanly inference §6 made here. So there is no patch to port,
and the mini working where a duck does not would be an environmental difference (allowance, board
network, `libnice` build) rather than a code one.

What the mini does have and `mediad` does not is a **negotiation watchdog**: 12 s from
`consumer-added` to `connection-state == connected`, after which it ends the session with a named
reason rather than leaving a client spinning. Its comment names the culprit it was written for —
"`libnice` frozen mid-`CHECKING` (a known crash mode of certain `libnice` versions)" — which is a
second way a session negotiates perfectly and carries nothing, distinct from having no usable
candidate pair. Worth having for the same reason the candidate tally is: it separates two failures
that look identical from outside.

**The proxy is the Space, and the name in front of it was the dead part.** `turn.fastrtc.org` —
what `fastrtc`'s own code points at and what `reachy_mini` #1182 copied into this arrangement — is
a dangling delegation, not an outage: the `.org` registry names four Route53 nameservers for the
zone, the registration is healthy and locked until 2027, and all four nameservers answer `REFUSED`
for the zone they are authoritative for, which is what Route53 says when the hosted zone behind
them is gone. `fastrtc/turn-service`, the Space that alias pointed at, never stopped answering.
So `DEFAULT_TURN_ENDPOINT` addresses it directly, at
`https://fastrtc-turn-service.hf.space/credentials`, and the vanity record is out of the path.

**That also closes a token-exfiltration route, which is the half that mattered more than the
outage.** A dangling Route53 delegation is a known takeover shape — create hosted zones until AWS
assigns you one of the four delegated nameservers, and one is enough, because a resolver needs
only one authoritative answer. Whoever landed it would serve records for the name, pass DNS
validation for a certificate on it, and be handed the account token every signed-in robot sends
as a bearer header every five minutes. That token is the robot's whole credential; §2.4 is about
how broad its scopes are.

**The endpoint is checked before the token can reach it.** `turn::parse_endpoint` is a `clap`
`value_parser` on `--turn-url`: `https` unless the host is loopback, no userinfo, no query and no
fragment. A wrong value stops the daemon at argument parsing rather than becoming a warning every
thirty seconds. Redirects need no separate guard — `reqwest` strips `Authorization` when a
redirect crosses scheme, host or port (`src/redirect.rs`, `remove_sensitive_headers`), so the
token cannot be walked to a third-party origin.

**The allowance is the robot owner's, and it is finite** — 10 GB a month on a free Hugging Face
account. A relayed video session is roughly a gigabyte an hour, so a robot driven hard over a
relay can spend it, after which the proxy answers with no relay servers and `turn.rs` logs "the
TURN proxy offered no relay servers" at info level. That is indistinguishable from a robot that
was never offered one, which is a legibility gap worth closing when somebody hits it. It is also
the argument `stream.rs` makes for sending frames outbound rather than through a relay.

**Something now notices when it dies, which is the reason this went unnoticed for three months.**
The endpoint was already dead when #1182 shipped it, and the only symptom was a warning in a log
and a candidate type nobody counted. `.github/workflows/turn-endpoint.yml` runs daily: one
authenticated `GET` against `DEFAULT_TURN_ENDPOINT`, asserting 200 and at least one `turn:`/
`turns:` entry. Every other check in the repository passes regardless, because every one of them
pairs two peers on one network, which never looks at a relay.

Three things about its shape are deliberate. It reads the URL **out of `turn.rs` with `sed`**
rather than keeping a copy, because a check holding its own endpoint tests whatever it was last
told and can drift from what the daemon compiles in — and a green check on a URL no robot uses is
worse than no check, since it reads as proof. It is **not** on `pull_request`: the failure being
guarded against is "nobody touched this for months", which a PR trigger cannot see, and a third
party's outage must never block unrelated work. And a **missing `HF_TOKEN` secret fails** rather
than skipping, because a check that quietly skips itself into permanent silence is the exact
failure mode it exists to end.

Two things this deliberately does not do:

- **Our own proxy.** This endpoint is a small service holding a Cloudflare Calls key and minting
  short-lived credentials for a caller with a valid HF token, and running one ourselves would end
  the dependency on a dormant project's Space — `--turn-url` is already the seam it plugs into.
  Worth doing, and not worth blocking relay coverage on: `*.hf.space` is `{owner}-{space}`, so it
  breaks if `fastrtc` renames or removes the Space, and there is no CNAME layer left to repoint.
  That is the residual risk, named rather than closed.
- **A Cloudflare key on the robot**, using `TURN_KEY_ID` and `TURN_KEY_API_TOKEN` directly. Fastest
  and worst: a long-lived API token on every board, which is the shape of mistake §2.4 exists to
  stop making.

Nothing about a relay is fatal. `add-turn-server` is checked for existence before it is emitted —
a panic in a C closure aborts the process rather than unwinding, which `pipeline.rs` learned once
already — a refused URI is a line in the journal, and a robot that cannot offer a relay is
reachable from most places rather than none. **And a TURN URI carries a password**, so only the
host half is ever logged.

## 7. Authorisation, restated now that there is an account

§4 of `remote-webrtc.md` argues the robot needs no gate of its own because a bridged session was
authenticated twice before it arrived — the client to the service, the robot outward with a token —
and that the trust therefore *moved* into the service rather than vanishing. This page does not change
that argument; it adds the one thing §4 could not name, which is **when the binding happens and who
performs it**:

- Before `account.login`, a duck is unreachable from outside the LAN. There is nothing to attack.
- After it, one account owns it, and `account.login`/`account.logout` are the calls that can move
  that ownership. They are routed to every transport, including WebRTC, and §2.6 is the argument
  for that plus the three properties that make it hold — a robot already signed in refuses, the
  binding is readable by anybody, and it is revocable from more places than the robot.
- **A remote peer re-binding the robot is a narrower risk than it looks**, and it is worth being
  precise about why: only clients of the account the robot *currently* belongs to can reach it
  remotely at all, so a remote `account.login` is the owner's own client. The exposure that is
  real is the LAN one, and that is what `force` exists for.
- A robot that changes hands must be logged out. That is the same list as the pairing PIN and the
  calibration — a hand-over process, in M6 — and this is one more item on it, worth adding while the
  list is still being written rather than after a second-hand duck streams to a stranger.
- The token is a bearer credential in a file, so a stolen board yields it. The answer is §2.4's
  read-only scopes, not encryption: a robot has to read this file unattended at boot, so anything
  it can decrypt without a human is something the thief can decrypt too. Which is the sharpest
  argument for narrowing the scopes — as it stands, a stolen duck yields a token that can write to
  its owner's repositories.

## 8. Order of work

Five slices, and the first two are independently useful and need no client:

1. **`account login`** — the device flow, the token file, `account status`. `updaterd`. **Done**:
   three calls, three transports, two CLIs, and a token that renews itself. Verifiable on its own,
   which is what made it the first slice: it prints the Hugging Face username.
2. **The relay, registering only** — producer registration, the negotiated heartbeat, reconnect and
   backoff, the split-brain poll. `mediad`. **Done**: `mediad::relay`, a task with no GStreamer in
   it, inert until `/etc/robot/hf-token` exists and picking it up without a restart when it does.
   Verifiable with no client at all: the service's dashboard counts a producer and
   `/api/robot-status` lists the duck.
3. **The client, hosted.** §5. Ahead of session translation rather than after it, which is a change
   of order and the reason for it is verification: the service ships no front-end of its own — `GET
   /` is a status page counting peers, producers and sessions — and its consumers are the mini's
   mobile and desktop apps, which would drive a duck with a mini's method names. So there is
   nothing to connect with that we do not write, and translating sessions first would mean
   building the half that can only be tested against a fake.
4. **Session translation** — a remote consumer gets video and the `control` channel. **Done**:
   `relay::bridge` opens `ws://127.0.0.1:<--port>` as a consumer when a session is asked for,
   rewrites `sessionId` per hop, reads no payload, refuses a second session by name, and tells the
   service when a session ends however it ends — including the case where there is no producer to
   bridge to, which is a robot whose pipeline never reached PLAYING.
5. **STUN decided; TURN offered by the robot.** §6. **Done**: `stun.l.google.com:19302` on both
   ends, and `mediad::turn` keeps Cloudflare credentials fresh so every consumer's offer carries a
   `relay` candidate — from `fastrtc-turn-service.hf.space`, the Space itself, because the alias
   in front of it is a dangling delegation. §6 has the argument; the three things to carry away
   are that only the robot needs credentials, that reading them must never block the thread
   building an offer, and that no check in this repo would notice if that endpoint died again.

## 9. What is open, and who can close it

| | needs |
|---|---|
| §2.4 the scope breadth | one public device-code client in the `pollen-robotics` HF org with `openid profile read-repos`, created by somebody with org admin. Not blocking — a scope change is a re-login — and it should not ship without it |
| a calibration for the camera | `media.video` publishes the module's design figures with `calibrated: false`, which is enough to map a room and not enough for metrology. Measuring one robot and writing `[media.intrinsics]` closes it for that robot; a per-unit calibration in provisioning closes it for the family. §11 of `remote-webrtc.md` |
| everything on the wire should be timestamped at source | `remote-webrtc.md` §11: `abs-capture-time` on the media, checked against what `webrtcsink`, a browser and `aiortc` actually surface; and a monotonic-plus-epoch field on every control-channel notification that describes a moment. Wanted for any consumer that has to relate what the robot saw to what it felt — visual-inertial SLAM is the case that makes it concrete — and it wants its own version bump rather than riding along with a transport |
| §2.6 `logout` revokes nothing | whether Hugging Face accepts a revocation for the first-party device-code client, checked rather than assumed. Not blocking — signing out stops the robot being reachable, and a stolen board is answered on hf.co — but it is the difference between "forgotten" and "revoked" |
| §6 the relay check needs a token | `.github/workflows/turn-endpoint.yml` exists and runs daily, and fails until an `HF_TOKEN` secret is set on the repository — a Hugging Face token with no scope beyond sign-in, used only to mint TURN credentials. Failing loudly is deliberate; the alternative is a check that skips itself into silence |
| §6 the relay is somebody else's Space | a credentials proxy of our own, holding the Cloudflare key in one place instead of trusting a dormant project's Space to keep its name. `--turn-url` is the seam. Not blocking — the Space answers — but `*.hf.space` is `{owner}-{space}` and there is no alias left to repoint if it moves |

Closed since this page was written: the OAuth client (§2.3 — Hugging Face ships one), whether the
token expires (§2.7 — thirty days, with a rotating refresh token), which rendezvous to use (§4 —
the mini's), whether we can read it (§4 — we maintain it; the "private repo" in an earlier draft
was a wrong-name 401), where the client is served (§5 — a static Space with `hf_oauth`, because
the question was never hosting but how a page gets a token), and which relay endpoint to use (§6 —
the Space itself; the alias in front of it is a dangling delegation).

One item this page created and closed: **peers are keyed by token**, so two things sharing one
take turns being reachable. Not a provisioning problem — images are built from scratch, not cloned,
so no second board ever receives a copy — but it *is* a constraint on consumers: a cloud backend
must authenticate with its own token, not the robot's, or it takes the robot off the listing by
connecting. §3.7.

## 10. Not doing

- **The `teleop` datachannel.** `remote-webrtc.md` §6 owns it; a remote session makes head-of-line
  blocking more visible, not more urgent.
- **`update.*` mutations over a remote session.** §8 of `remote-webrtc.md` says what it will take, and
  the answer is a client that survives the restart rather than anything here.
- **Multi-peer.** One media session at a time, as before.
- **Per-session consent.** An M5 item, orthogonal to this page and made more pointed by it: a stream
  that can be started from another continent is the case `architecture.md` §7 was written for.
- **A duck-specific mobile app.** #107 designs one and M6 owns the phone spike. This page's client
  question (§5) is deliberately answerable without it.
