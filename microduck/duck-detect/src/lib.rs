//! Finding other Microducks in this Microduck's camera, on the NPU.
//!
//! The model is trained in [`duck_detector`](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/duck_detector) and
//! arrives here as an INT8 `.rknn`: one class, 320×320 in, 2100 candidate boxes out. This crate is
//! the three things between a camera frame and a bounding box — the letterbox, the runtime, and the
//! decode — plus `duck-bench`, which measures them on a real board.
//!
//! The sampler that turns a `UYVY` frame the right way up and shrinks it is not here: it is in
//! [`uyvy`], because `mediad` and `robotctl monitor` need the same arithmetic and must not link a
//! model runtime to get it.
//!
//! **Everything here has to agree with how the model was trained**, and nothing enforces that
//! across the two repositories except this comment and the numbers below:
//!
//! * frames are letterboxed, not stretched, into a square, padded with 114 grey;
//! * RGB, not BGR;
//! * the picture is the one `mediad` has already turned the right way up (`--rotate`, default 90°),
//!   because that is what the dataset was captured through.
//!
//! Get one of those wrong and the detector does not fail — it just gets quietly worse, which is the
//! failure mode this crate is most exposed to.
