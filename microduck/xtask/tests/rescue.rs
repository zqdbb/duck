//! What the boot recovery net decides: `scripts/robot-boot-check` and `scripts/robot-rescue`,
//! exercised against a temporary tree.
//!
//! This is the code that has to work when everything else does not, and the code least amenable to a
//! test: on a real board it runs only when a release cannot start. So both halves are written to be
//! askable without a board — the rescue's decision is a pure function of two symlinks and a
//! breadcrumb, and the check's is a pure function of what `systemctl show` answers. `ROBOT_*`
//! environment variables move the tree, the state dir, the rescue's path and the uptime source, and a
//! stub `systemctl` on `PATH` supplies unit states and records whether a reboot was asked for.
//!
//! What that leaves uncovered is real and worth naming: **systemd itself**. Whether the timer fires
//! at `OnBootSec=180`, whether the oneshot's `Conflicts=shutdown.target` keeps it off the way down,
//! and whether `NRestarts` reads the way this assumes on a crash-looping unit — none of that is here.
//! It needs real systemd — `systemd-nspawn`, or a privileged container with it as pid 1 — which
//! `docs/project/install-path-gap.md` makes the case for and `docs/design/boot-recovery-net.md` says
//! why this mechanism in particular wants it.
//!
//! In `xtask` because these are *repository scripts* rather than any crate's behaviour, which is what
//! the rest of this directory is for. `sh` and not `bash`: they run on a board where the interpreter
//! is whatever `/bin/sh` is, and the flag detection inside the rescue (`mv -T` on GNU, `mv -h` on
//! BSD) exists precisely because the same script has to work here and there.
