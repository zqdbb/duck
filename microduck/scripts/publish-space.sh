# Publish one of `spaces/` to the Hugging Face Space that serves it.
#
# The source lives in this repository for the reason `remote-access-design.md` §5 gives about the
# console: a Space consuming a duck tracks things that live here — the rendezvous protocol, the
# robot's own method names, the camera's geometry — and a copy in a Space repo drifts from all of
# them. This is the deploy, by hand while there are two of them.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/publish-space.sh vision-demo
#   scripts/publish-space.sh vision-demo --space pollen-robotics/other-name --dry-run
#
# Pushing needs a Hugging Face token with write access. `hf auth login` stores one and git will
# ask otherwise; this script never reads it.

# Copied rather than synced: a file deleted here stays in the Space until somebody removes it
# there. Deliberate — a `--delete` that ran against the wrong Space id would remove somebody's
# work, and these are hand-run.
#
# Files only, and `find` rather than a glob for one reason: running a Space locally leaves a
# `__pycache__` beside its source (gitignored, so it stays there), and `cp` without `-r` fails on
# a directory instead of skipping it — which under `set -e` aborts the publish after the clone,
# for a reason that has nothing to do with the Space.
#
# **Symlinks are followed and flattened, which is how two Spaces share a client.** `spaces/shared`
# holds the modules that speak this project's protocols — the control lane, the rendezvous
# listing — and each Space links to the ones it uses. A Space repo cannot have a parent directory,
# so `-type l` and `cp -L` turn the link into the file at publish time. Duplicating those modules
# per Space instead is the drift `remote-access-design.md` §5 keeps their source in this
# repository to avoid, and two copies in one repository would drift just as happily.

# diffing the index sees additions, deletions and modifications alike.
