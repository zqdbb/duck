//! IPC contracts between the robot's services and their clients.
//!
//! Two namespaces over one wire format:
//!
//!  - `update.*` — `updaterd`'s API, spoken by `robotctl` and later `btd`.
//!  - `robot.*`  — `robotd`'s API. Small on purpose: it is what `updaterd` needs in order
//!    to decide whether an update is safe and whether it worked.
//!
//! **Wire format: JSON-RPC 2.0, one object per line (NDJSON), over a unix socket.**
//! Framing is a single newline. Progress is pushed as a JSON-RPC notification, a message
//! with no `id`, so a client that reconnects mid-update resubscribes and keeps receiving
//! them.
//!
//! ```text
//! → {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"update.apply","params":{...}}
//! ← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"update.progress","params":{...}}   (no id)
//! ← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"update.progress","params":{...}}
//! ← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{...}}
//! ```
//!
//! A method and its parameters are always paired through [`Call`]: build a request with
//! [`Request::call`], read one back with [`Request::as_call`]. There is no way to send a
//! method with another method's parameters.
//!
//! Why JSON-RPC, why a unix socket, and what was measured against both:
//! `docs/design/architecture.md` §2.2.
//!
//! Dependencies stay at serde, serde_json and semver. Every service speaks these types,
//! including the ones on the recovery path, so nothing here may pull in http, tar, crypto
//! or an async runtime.

/// Protocol version, exchanged via [`Call::Hello`].
///
/// Bumped on any incompatible change. A peer speaking a different version is refused
/// rather than misparsed — a stale `robotctl` in someone's shell is normal.
///
/// v2 added `HelloResult::revision`. v3 added the `net.*` and `system.*` namespaces. v4 added
/// `system.authenticate`, which a BLE client must now pass before anything else is served — a v3
/// client would otherwise have every call refused with no idea why. v5 added the `pad.*`
/// namespace, which is additive — a v4 client loses nothing by not knowing it — and bumps anyway,
/// because the version's job is to say "these two peers were not built together". v6 added
/// `robot.init` and `robot.relax`, so powering the joints stops being a subcommand that fights the
/// daemon for the motor bus. During prototyping the wire shape simply changes and this bumps; no
/// accommodation is made for peers that predate a field, because there are none in the field yet.
///
/// # The rule, since a bump has consequences and nothing else states them
///
/// **A bump promises nothing in either direction.** It is not "additive unless stated": v5 was
/// additive and v4 was not, and the constant does not distinguish them. Every binary on a board is
/// expected to come from one release, and the install path is what delivers that.
///
/// **No daemon refuses a call because this number differs.** `updaterd` used to refuse `hello` on
/// an exact `!=`. The premise was sound — a bump promises nothing — and the conclusion did not
/// follow from it: what actually breaks a mismatched peer is a *route it cannot reach* or a
/// *parameter shape that moved*, and each of those refuses itself, by name, on the one call that
/// cannot be served. A gate on the handshake fired on all of them instead, including the calls that
/// were perfectly serveable and including `update apply`, which is how a skew ends. The difference
/// is now *reported* — in `updaterd`'s journal, and in [`HelloResult::api_version`] for a client to
/// compare against its own — and refused nowhere. See `updater/src/ipc.rs`.
///
/// **What refuses instead, and it is narrower on purpose.** A method this release does not have is
/// [`code::METHOD_NOT_FOUND`] naming the method ([`Request::as_call`]). A member of `params` this
/// release does not know is [`code::INVALID_PARAMS`] naming the member, because every params type
/// denies unknown fields — which is the strictness the handshake was reaching for, moved to where it
/// can tell a changed call from an unchanged one. Both were wanted regardless of the gate: v7 added
/// `ApplyOptions::from_dir`, and an older `updaterd` that merely *ignored* it would have installed
/// from its configured source while the operator believed they were sideloading a directory. Silence
/// was the danger there, not disagreement. It reaches only forward — a daemon built before this
/// cannot refuse what it was already ignoring — which is one more reason the bump is still worth
/// making.
///
/// **What a bump therefore costs.** Two peers from different releases are still not interchangeable:
/// a method whose shape moved will fail. It fails on that method now rather than on the handshake,
/// and for the few seconds after an update it costs nothing at all — `robotctl` is a symlink into
/// `current`, so it follows the new release immediately, while `updaterd` is mid-restart of itself.
/// A client that is *persistently* older is a copy taken from somewhere other than
/// `/usr/local/bin/robotctl`.
/// # v7 — `ApplyOptions::from_dir`
///
/// First ships in 0.5.0, which is therefore the version a board has to be on before
/// `robotctl update apply --from` can put anything there.
///
/// **It bumps even though `from_dir` is an optional field an older daemon would happily parse.**
/// That is the reason to bump rather than a reason not to: serde ignores what it does not know, so a
/// v6 `updaterd` would accept `update.apply --from /some/dir` and quietly install from its
/// *configured* source instead — a mirror of the release the operator meant to sideload, or nothing
/// at all.
///
/// Refusing the call outright is what the handshake used to be for, and it is now the params
/// decoder's job: an unknown member of `params` is an [`code::INVALID_PARAMS`] naming the member. A
/// v6 daemon predates that and still ignores the field, which is exactly why the bump stays — it is
/// the honest label for two peers that do not share a release.
/// # v8 — `pad.input`
///
/// A namespace addition of the kind v5 was, and it bumps for the same stated reason: the constant
/// says "these two peers were not built together", not "nothing you knew has changed".
///
/// **What it costs here is smaller than usual, and worth being precise about.** The new method is
/// served by `padd` on a socket of its own, so no existing client loses anything by not knowing it,
/// and a `robotctl` that asks an older `padd` for it finds no socket at all rather than a refusal.
/// The bump lands on nothing that refuses: it records that two peers differ, and the rule that every
/// binary on a board comes from one release is kept by the install path rather than by a handshake.
///
/// # v9 — the skill intents
///
/// `robot.do` (ground pick, kicks, sit↔stand, roulade), `robot.pose` (standing body pose),
/// `robot.mouth`, `robot.shutdown` (sit, then power off) and `robot.mode` (walk vs roller),
/// ported from `microduck_runtime`; `robot.enable` gains `toggle`, the pad's Start
/// evaluated robot-side. Additive, and bumps anyway, per the rule above.
///
/// # v10 — `robot.sound`
///
/// The robot's voice: play a voice-bank tag (chirp, greet, coo, ...), with `wheee` as a
/// held ride the client keeps alive per tick. Additive, same rule.
///
/// # v11 — `tof.stream`
///
/// The head ToF sensor's 8×8 depth frames, served by `tofd` on its own socket. A new
/// namespace, like `pad.*` was: nothing existing changes shape, and a client built before
/// this simply never asks.
///
/// # v12 — `robot.look`
///
/// Gaze as a point instead of joint angles: `robot.head`'s doc always promised both forms,
/// and this is the second one — the daemon runs the IK and answers with the joints it chose.
///
/// # v14 — `robot.chorale`, `chorale.*`
///
/// Several ducks singing one piece in four parts, synchronised over BLE advertisements with no
/// shared clock. `robot.chorale` is the switch; the `chorale.*` namespace is how `btd` — which owns
/// the radio — and `robotd` — which owns the behaviour and the voice — divide the work. Additive:
/// a client that never asks is unaffected, and `chorale.*` is between daemons rather than for
/// clients at all.
///
/// # v13 — `robot.theremin`
///
/// The head ToF becomes an instrument: a hand's distance is the pitch, and the mouth opens
/// with it. Additive, same rule as every method before it — plus an optional `theremin`
/// block in `robot.state`, absent while the instrument is down, so a client from v12 sees
/// exactly the frame it saw before.
///
/// # v15 — `robot.setMode`
///
/// Walk and roller stop being a startup constant: the mode can be switched while the robot runs,
/// which is what the gamepad's held D-pad up does. Additive as a method — but `robot.mode`'s
/// answer, and the policy names in the `robot.subscribe` acknowledgement, can now *change* during
/// a session. A client that read either once and cached it forever was already making an
/// assumption this method breaks; nothing about a frame's shape changes.
///
/// # v16 — `update.show`
///
/// The per-run update transcript: what `updaterd` actually did, phase by phase, with the
/// manifest it verified, the hook output it collected and the units it restarted. Additive
/// as a method — a client that never asks is unaffected — and `update.log`'s entries gain a
/// `run` number pointing at one, which an older client ignores as an unknown member because
/// results are not `deny_unknown_fields`. An older `updaterd` answers `update.show` with
/// [`code::METHOD_NOT_FOUND`] naming it, which is the designed skew behaviour rather than a
/// handshake refusal.
///
/// # v23 — `account.*`
///
/// A robot can belong to a Hugging Face account, which is the thing that has to be true before it
/// can be reached from outside its own LAN: the robot's relay proves to a rendezvous service that
/// it belongs to an account, the service shows a client only its own robots, and those two
/// together are the authorisation a bridged session arrives with. Nothing about the *robot's* own
/// gate changes — there still is not one — see `docs/design/remote-access-design.md` §7.
///
/// Additive as methods, and `updaterd` serves them for the reasons `policy.*` is there: it is the
/// daemon with a network stack, and the credential it stores is also what would reach a private
/// Hub repo. An older `updaterd` answers [`code::METHOD_NOT_FOUND`] naming the method, which is
/// the designed skew behaviour rather than a handshake refusal.
///
/// **`account.login` answers with a code rather than with a token**, and that shape is not an
/// implementation detail: the flow is RFC 8628, so somebody has to read a short code and approve
/// it in a browser, and the client that showed them the code may well be gone by the time they
/// do — a phone that opens a browser backgrounds itself, and iOS then tears the GATT link down.
/// So `login` returns immediately, `updaterd` owns the waiting, and `status` is what a client
/// comes back to. A login that reported success by holding the connection open would work on a
/// laptop and fail on the device it is for.
///
/// # v22 — `robot.skills`, `robot.setSkill`, `robot.removeSkill`
///
/// The last thing in the policy path a terminal on the robot could reach and nothing else could.
/// `[[policy.skill]]` is a repeating table, so `robotctl policy add` wrote it directly — there
/// was no method to route, and a remote client could fetch a policy and fill a *slot* with it but
/// never make it answer to `robot.do` by name.
///
/// `robotd` writes the file and reloads itself, so one call is the whole operation. The
/// alternative was a client writing and then remembering `robot.reloadPolicies`, and one that
/// forgot would leave a robot whose config and behaviour disagree until the next restart.
///
/// [`SkillParams`] is the same shape read and written, and every optional field means "the
/// default for this" — so a client may list, change one field and send it back. An entry that
/// already exists supplies whatever the call leaves out.
///
/// [`SkillsResult`] also carries `built_in`: the names `robot.do` answers to that are not table
/// entries, because the daemon drives them itself. A client listing what a robot can do needs
/// both, and `policies.skills` alone omitted two of the five the pad ships bound to — the same
/// trap `do_names` exists to close on the robot side.
///
/// # v21 — `pad.bindings`, `pad.bind`
///
/// Which button runs which skill stops being a thing only somebody at a keyboard on the robot can
/// change. `robotctl pad bind` edited the config file directly, so unlike every other command it
/// had no wire surface at all and routing could not help.
///
/// **Two methods in `pad.*` that `configd` does not serve.** The rest of that namespace is about
/// the radio and is `configd`'s; a binding is about what a button does to the robot, and checking
/// a name needs the skill list, which only `robotd` has. Routing is per method throughout, so
/// this costs nothing — `policy.*` and `robot.loadPolicy` already split one concept across two
/// daemons the same way. An older `updaterd` or `configd` reached by mistake answers
/// [`code::METHOD_NOT_FOUND`] naming it.
///
/// Additive as methods. `pad.bind` is the first call on either radio transport that **writes the
/// config file**, and it has to be: `padd` re-reads `[pad]` every second, so a binding held in
/// memory would be reverted before the caller let go of the phone. That also means it needs no
/// reload and no restart.
///
/// # v20 — `robot.policies` carries the skills
///
/// One field, and it is what makes any of this usable from something that is not `robotctl`:
/// which one-shot skills a robot has is config now, so a client cannot assume a list and cannot
/// offer a "bow" button without being told there is a bow. The names were already published in
/// `robot.subscribe`'s acknowledgement, but that is a 50 Hz stream and the question is asked
/// once — the wrong shape for a phone, and BLE deliberately does not route it.
///
/// Additive: a client that ignores the field is unaffected, and an older `robotd` omits it,
/// which deserialises to empty rather than failing because results are not
/// `deny_unknown_fields`. A client reading an empty list should treat it as "this robot did not
/// say" rather than "this robot has no skills" — the same distinction `unavailable` draws for
/// the gait.
///
/// # v19 — `policy.*` and `robot.reloadPolicies`
///
/// The official policy set stops needing a daemon release to change. `policy.check` asks the Hub
/// what revisions exist against the one installed, `policy.install` fetches one, and
/// `robot.reloadPolicies` is how the thing that swapped the set tells `robotd` to re-read it —
/// necessary because installing a set swaps a symlink *underneath* unchanged paths, so
/// `robot.loadPolicy` would correctly conclude there was nothing to do.
///
/// Additive as methods. `policy.*` is the first namespace `updaterd` serves that is not
/// `update.*`, and it is there rather than in `robotd` because it needs a network stack, and not
/// in `robotctl` because that must not link one. See `docs/design/policy-channel-design.md` §8.
///
/// # v18 — `robot.policies`, `robot.loadPolicy`
///
/// Which `.onnx` fills a slot stops being a restart-only decision: a policy can be swapped into
/// one slot while the robot runs, and dropped again, without editing a file by hand. Additive as
/// methods, and the state they expose was previously unavailable at all rather than available in
/// another shape, so nothing an older client reads changes meaning — the policy names in the
/// `robot.subscribe` acknowledgement could already change mid-session as of v15.
///
/// **`robot.loadPolicy` persists.** A slot is `[policy] <slot>` in `robotd.toml` and nothing
/// else, so the daemon writes the key before it queues the swap and a gait chosen over the wire
/// is the gait the robot boots into. Worth stating on the wire rather than only in the daemon,
/// because it is the difference between a call a client offers as "try this" and one it offers
/// as "use this" — and the undo is the same method with no path, not a restart.
///
/// An older `robotd` answers either with [`code::METHOD_NOT_FOUND`] naming the method, which is
/// the designed skew behaviour and not a handshake refusal. See
/// `docs/design/policy-channel-design.md` §8.
///
/// # v17 — a unit state that can say "crash loop"
///
/// [`UnitState`] gains `Restarting` and `Failed`, which `system.services` can now answer with.
/// Not additive in the way a new method is: an older client deserialising a `Vec<ServiceUnit>`
/// rejects a member it has no variant for, and `robotctl` reads that reply with `.ok()` — so an
/// older `robotctl` against this `configd` prints no `units` block at all rather than a wrong one.
/// Both come out of the same release and an apply restarts both, so the skew lasts as long as the
/// update does; a board left mid-update sees a missing block, not a lie.
///
/// # v24 — a clock every stream shares, and what a map needs from the robot
///
/// Three additive fields and one read, for a mapper that pairs a camera frame with the joint
/// angles and depth cells of the same instant (`docs/design/robotd-design.md` §mapping):
///
/// - [`RobotState::t_ns`] and [`TofFrame::t_ns`] are the same `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`, nanoseconds,
///   so a sample from `robotd` and a frame from `tofd` can be put on one axis without guessing
///   the offset between two daemons' start times. `t` and `at_us` stay as they were.
/// - [`RobotState::imu`] is the trunk IMU as the loop sees it: gyro and orientation, not only
///   the projected gravity [`SafetyState`] already carried. [`RobotState::frames`] is the
///   camera and ToF sensor pose in the trunk frame, from the same head FK `robot.look` uses —
///   published so no client has to carry a copy of the kinematics.
/// - `robot.model` ([`ModelResult`]) answers the static geometry those poses are stated in.
///
/// `mediad`'s `media.video` answer gains `mono_ns` and `real_ns`, the two clocks read at the
/// same instant, so a peer can put RTP timestamps (whose RTCP sender reports are wall-clock)
/// onto the same monotonic axis. Additive everywhere: an older client ignores fields it does
/// not know, and an older daemon leaves them at their defaults (zero, or absent).
///
/// # v25 — the whole skeleton's pose, for a viewer
///
/// [`RobotState::skeleton`] carries every body's pose in the trunk frame this tick, and
/// [`ModelResult::skeleton`] the matching static tree (each link's name and parent). Together they
/// let a viewer draw the robot moving for real — the full kinematics, of which
/// [`RobotState::frames`] (camera, ToF, head IMU) is a few leaves — without carrying a copy of the
/// kinematics, the same reason `frames` and `tof_beams` come from the robot. Both from the same FK
/// `robot.look` uses. Additive: the `Vec`s are empty from a daemon predating it.
///
/// # v26 — `system.logs`
///
/// The tail of one daemon's journal, over the wire. Until now the answer to "what did it say
/// before it stopped" was `journalctl` over ssh, which needs a network the robot may not have and
/// an address a phone has no way to reach — so the one question support asks first was the one
/// question the wire could not answer.
///
/// Additive as a method, and narrow on purpose: a unit from a fixed list, a line count, and which
/// boot. Not a `journalctl` command line — see [`LogsParams`] for why that boundary is where it is.
///
/// An older `configd` answers [`code::METHOD_NOT_FOUND`] naming the method, which is the designed
/// skew and not a handshake refusal: a new `duckctl` against a robot on an older release reports
/// that the robot is too old rather than failing obscurely.
///
/// # v28 — `detector.*`
///
/// The duck detector leaves the release the way the policies did at v19: `mediad` reads it from
/// `/opt/robot/detector/current`, the release's postinstall hook seeds that from a pinned Hub
/// revision, and `detector.check` / `detector.install` are how a board asks what exists and
/// moves to it — `policy.check` / `policy.install` with a different root, answered by the same
/// daemon for the same reason (it has the network stack). An install restarts `mediad`, which is
/// where the model is loaded, and says whether that took.
///
/// Additive as methods; the parameters and answers are the policy set's own types.
///
/// # v27 — the pad's IMU, on the pad tap
///
/// Three more [`PadReport`] variants: a pad's inertial unit as a second evdev node beside the one
/// that drives, its samples, and its going away. The "Pro Controller" Switch clones ship a
/// six-axis IMU and the kernel's `hid-nintendo` exposes it as a separate accelerometer device
/// under the same HID parent; an Xbox pad has none and a subscriber never sees the variants.
///
/// A new variant on a tagged enum is what a robotctl built before it cannot decode, which is the
/// one reason this is a bump rather than a note: the tap is still `padd`'s own socket, and every
/// other client is untouched.
/// # v30 — `homed`, so a client can wait instead of guessing
///
/// One `Option<bool>` on [`PoliciesResult`]. `robot.do` refuses a skill while the robot is on its
/// way to its home pose, and that refusal is a second old and resolves by itself — but from the
/// wire it is `accepted: false` and a sentence, indistinguishable from "press Start on the pad",
/// which stays true until somebody acts. A client that installs a policy triggers a reload,
/// the reload sends the robot home, and the `robot.do` that follows is refused by the client's own
/// previous call. Without this the only ways out are matching on the reason string or retrying
/// blindly through refusals that will never clear.
///
/// `None` is "this robot does not say", which is what an older `robotd` sends and what a client
/// must fall back from rather than read as `false`.
/// # v31 — `sitting`, because "stand up" is two calls
///
/// One more `Option<bool>` on [`PoliciesResult`], beside `homed` and for the same reason: a client
/// choosing what to send needs the robot's answer rather than its own guess. A duck on its feet
/// stands with `robot.init`; a duck in its seat is held there by the `sit_toggle` latch, and
/// `init` argues with that rather than winning. Without it a client either guesses — sitting a
