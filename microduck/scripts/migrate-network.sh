# Move wifi from netplan to NetworkManager, once, on a board that arrived on Armbian's stock
# networking.
#
# Split from `setup-board.sh` for two reasons that are not about file size:
#
#  1. **Different lifetime.** The overlay fix and the ONNX install in `setup-board.sh` are
#     permanent — every board needs them forever. This script exists *only* because Armbian's
#     stock image ships netplan + systemd-networkd + wpa_supplicant. The day we build a robot
#     image with NetworkManager already in it, this whole file is deleted and nothing else
#     changes.
#  2. **Different risk.** Everything in `setup-board.sh` is safe to run at any time. This is
#     the one step that can make a headless board unreachable, and it needs a reboot to take
#     effect. That belongs behind an explicit decision rather than inside routine bring-up.
#
# Why NetworkManager at all: netplan is a config *generator*, not a runtime network manager.
# It has no scan API, and `netplan apply` reports "config applied" rather than whether
# association actually succeeded. "Show me the networks" and "that password was wrong" are
# the two things a phone provisioning a robot needs most, so wifi goes to NetworkManager —
# which `docs/design/architecture.md` §3 already names as the owner of wifi credentials. Ethernet
# stays with netplan and networkd, untouched.
#
# Run it twice, either side of the reboot — the second run retires the backstop:
#
#   sudo sh /tmp/migrate-network.sh
#   sudo reboot
#   sudo /usr/local/sbin/robot-migrate-network
#
# Full paths, because this advice gets copy-pasted: `sh migrate-network.sh` only works from
# whichever directory happens to hold the file, and it is fetched to /tmp.
#
# Then continue with `setup-board.sh`.
#
# Idempotent, and safe to re-run. It never reboots on its own.
