//! `updaterd` — the update daemon.
//!
//! Deliberately thin: parse args, load config, recover from any interrupted run,
//! then serve. All logic lives in the library so it can be tested without a
//! socket or a robot.
//!
//! **Startup order matters.** `Engine::recover_on_start` runs *before* the socket
//! is served, so a robot that booted into a bad release has already begun
//! reverting by the time anything can ask it to do something else.
//!
//! This process must be resident and must exclude *itself* from the units it
//! restarts — see `docs/design/updater-design.md` §4.
//!
//! **Resident is about triggers, not about applying.** Applying an update is a library
//! call, and mutual exclusion is a file lock in `state_dir` rather than a property of
//! there being one process ([`updater::engine::Engine::apply`]). What needs a daemon is
//! everything *around* an update: a socket for the app to trigger through, progress to
//! stream back, a timer so a mandatory release can pull a robot forward with nobody
//! present, and a process at boot for the boot counter to recover through. None of that
//! applies to a robot's first install, which is what the `install` subcommand is for.
