//! What a camera frame is, before anything decides what it means.
//!
//! The head camera hands out `UYVY` at 1280×720 and is mounted a quarter turn off, so every
//! consumer of a frame does the same two things first: turn it the right way up, and sample it
//! down to the size it actually wants. Three of them do — `mediad` encoding a JPEG or a PNG,
//! `duck-detect` feeding a model, and `robotctl monitor` drawing one in a terminal — and this is
//! the one copy of that arithmetic, so a picture cannot come out upright in one and sideways in
//! the next.
//!
//! **The turn happens while sampling, not before it.** Both samplers walk their *output* and pull
//! the source pixel each one needs, so the rotation is a change of index inside a loop that was
//! already running rather than a pass of its own. [`Turn`] says why that matters: the pipeline
//! tried rotating in GStreamer once and it cost the board 22 fps.
