//! Keeping several ducks together without a shared clock.
//!
//! Four robots singing a chord have to agree on when the beat is, to about **±20 ms** — the
//! figure comes from [`super`]: an ensemble that agreed to the millisecond would sound like one
//! organ, so a few tens of milliseconds of spread is deliberately *added*, and the sync only has
//! to be tight enough not to swamp it.
//!
//! The obvious way is to sync the clocks and agree a start time. This does not do that, because
//! there is no clock to sync: the boards have no RTC agreement and no NTP, so establishing an
//! offset would mean a connection, a bond, and a central-role Bluetooth client that `btd` does
//! not have.
//!
//! ## The conductor is a beacon
//!
//! Instead, nobody shares a clock — they share a **beat**. The duck conducting puts a beat
//! counter in its BLE advertisement and bumps it once per musical beat. Everyone else passively
//! scans, and *the arrival of a new counter value is the downbeat*. No timestamps to compare, no
//! offset to estimate, no connection, no pairing: passive scanning is the whole radio
//! requirement, and it is the cheapest thing a Bluetooth controller can do.
//!
//! ## Why the radio's jitter does not sink it
//!
//! Air time is microseconds; the error is the **advertising slot**. The conductor hands new
//! payload to its controller and it goes out at the next slot, which `btd` spaces 100–150 ms
//! apart on purpose (one antenna carries BLE, the gamepad and wifi). So a follower hears each
//! beat somewhere in a 50 ms window, and — crucially — *independently per beat*.
//!
//! Two things turn that into ±6 ms:
//!
//!  - The conductor delays its **own** playback by [`SLOT_MEAN_S`], the middle of that window,
//!    so it is wrong in the same direction as everyone else rather than early by default.
//!  - A follower does not chase individual beats. It averages the *phase* over a sliding window
//!    ([`Follower::WINDOW`]), so independent jitter falls as the square root of the window.
//!
//! **The tempo is not estimated, and that was the fix rather than the shortcut.** The first
//! version fitted a straight line through (beat, arrival) and read the tempo off its slope, which
//! is the textbook thing to do and was measurably worse: a line fit evaluated at the *newest*
//! point — the edge of the window, which is exactly where "where are we now" is asked — carries
//! about four times the error it carries at the window's centre, because slope uncertainty
//! compounds with distance from the centroid. Two simulated followers came out 36 ms apart.
//! Holding the period at the score's tempo and averaging only the phase removes the slope term
//! entirely and lands at a third of that. It is also the honest model: both ducks read the tempo
//! off the same score, and their crystals differ by parts per million — 3 ms over a minute-long
//! piece, against the tens of milliseconds the estimator itself was contributing.
//!
//! Everything in this module is a pure function of observed arrival times, so the claim above is
//! a test rather than an argument: [`tests::two_followers_agree_within_the_ensemble_budget`]
//! drives simulated beacons through a simulated 50 ms slot window and checks what comes out.
//!
//! ## What it does when the radio stops
//!
//! Keeps singing. A follower that hears nothing holds its last phase and carries on at the
//! score's tempo — good to a crystal's accuracy, milliseconds per minute — and picks the beat back
//! up when the conductor reappears. That is also exactly what a singer does when they cannot hear
//! the conductor, and it is why the correction is a slow drag on the tempo rather than a jump.
