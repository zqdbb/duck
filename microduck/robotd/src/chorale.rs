//! Several ducks singing one piece: who conducts, who sings what, and where in the score we are.
//!
//! The behaviour half of the duck chorale. `btd` owns the radio and does no thinking; this owns the
//! thinking and touches no radio. What passes between them is `chorale.*`: a beacon to advertise
//! going down, and beacons heard coming up.
//!
//! ## Nobody is in charge until somebody is
//!
//! A duck asked for a chorale starts *listening*: it advertises an idle beacon saying it is
//! willing, and watches for others. When two willing ducks see each other the lower id conducts —
//! deterministic, so there is no election to go wrong and no message to lose. A duck that hears a
//! beacon already carrying a piece does not argue about it; it joins.
//!
//! ## The conductor owns the seating, and that is not a convenience
//!
//! Seating depends on join order ([`sounds::chorale::seat`]), so a duck seating *itself* from
//! whatever it happened to hear will disagree with a duck that heard a different subset — and both
//! will sing alto. So the conductor keeps the roster, broadcasts it, and everyone replays
//! [`sounds::chorale::seat_all`] over it. One source of truth, which is what a conductor is.
//!
//! A duck that cannot find itself in the roster is not in the piece yet: it keeps listening, and
//! the conductor adds it on the next beat. That is why joining is free rather than negotiated.
//!
//! ## Where the score position comes from
//!
//! Not a start time. There is no clock to agree on, so the conductor's beat counter *is* the
//! timebase: [`sounds::chorale::beat::Conductor`] for the duck holding it and `Follower` for
//! everyone else, and both answer the same question — how many beats into the piece are we, right
//! now. The audio side reads that and renders the score at it, so a duck whose audio stalls
//! resumes in the right place rather than a bar behind.
