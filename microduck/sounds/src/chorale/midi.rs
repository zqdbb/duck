//! Standard MIDI file in, chorale out — so a notation editor is the score editor.
//!
//! This is the front end that actually unlocks writing music for the ducks. The text format
//! ([`super::text`]) is good for a chorale you write by hand and read back, and it cannot
//! express four voices moving in four different rhythms. A MIDI file can, every notation editor
//! and DAW exports one, and the entire public-domain four-part repertoire is already available
//! as one — Bach chorales most of all, which are literally this genre.
//!
//! **No dependency.** A Standard MIDI File is a length-prefixed chunk format with variable-length
//! delta times, and the subset a score needs is note-on, note-off, tempo and track name. That is
//! a couple of hundred lines and no supply chain, against a crate that would parse controller
//! automation and SysEx this will never look at.
//!
//! ## How tracks become parts
//!
//! By **mean pitch**, not by track order — the lowest group of notes sings bass. Track order
//! would be the obvious rule and is wrong twice over: notation editors write scores top staff
//! first (soprano, alto, tenor, bass — the reverse of what a `Voicing` lists), and a file from a
//! DAW may have the tempo track, empty tracks, or the parts in any order at all. Sorting by
//! pitch is right whatever produced the file, and it is the same rule [`super::cast`] uses to
//! seat the ducks, which keeps one idea in one place. A track *name* that says "Soprano" is
//! believed first, since a human wrote it down.
//!
//! A single polyphonic track — one piano staff with chords in it, which is what "export MIDI"
//! gives you from a lot of tools — is split by pitch rank within each chord. Crude and better
//! than refusing: the lowest note of each chord is the bass line.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately dropped
//!
//! Velocity becomes the note's dynamic, which is free and right. Everything else — controllers,
//! pitch bend, program changes, anything past the first tempo — is skipped: a duck has one
//! oscillator and a mouth, and a tempo map would have to be honoured identically by four robots
//! agreeing over a network, which is a promise this cannot keep. A file with a tempo change
//! parses and is sung at its first tempo, with the fact reported rather than hidden.
