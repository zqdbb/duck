//! `duckctl` — the robot from a laptop.
//!
//! The phone app's stand-in, and the only way to test `btd` against a real radio.
//!
//! **Bluetooth is how it reaches a robot today, not what it is.** `mediad` gives a robot a second
//! transport that reaches a different set of methods by design — `robot.move` is refused over BLE
//! and permitted over WebRTC, `net.connect` the other way round — so the name says which robot
//! rather than which radio. It was called `duck-btctl` while BLE was the only answer.
//!
//! **Nothing on the robot depends on this crate**, which is what keeps `btleplug` out of a
//! release. It used to be an example of `btd` for the same purpose, obtained as a side effect of
//! the directory it sat in; a crate nobody depends on states it directly. `robotctl` is the tool
//! that ships, and it speaks unix sockets on the robot itself.
//!
//! `btleplug` rather than `bluer`, because this runs on a developer's machine: CoreBluetooth on
//! macOS, BlueZ on Linux, WinRT on Windows. `bluer` would restrict the client to Linux, which
//! defeats the point.
//!
//! It reuses `duck_ble::framing` deliberately. The chunking here is the *client* half of the same
//! module the robot uses, so if the framing were asymmetric this would not work — which makes
//! it a real test of the protocol rather than a reimplementation that could agree with itself.
//!
//! The one thing that *is* asymmetric is how long a line may be, and it has to be: the robot's cap
//! bounds what an unpaired peer in radio range can make it buffer, and this end has no such peer.
//! Sharing the tight one made every reply over 8 KiB unreadable here while `btd` served it
//! correctly — see `framing::MAX_REPLY_LINE`.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p duckctl -- scan          # robots in range, and their addresses
//! cargo run -p duckctl -- status
//! cargo run -p duckctl -- wifi scan
//! cargo run -p duckctl -- wifi connect "Pollen" --psk secret
//! cargo run -p duckctl -- name "Ducky"
//! cargo run -p duckctl -- call robot.health
//! cargo run -p duckctl -- logs robotd -n 100
//! ```
//!
//! `DUCK_ROBOT` and `DUCK_PIN` in the environment are the defaults for `--name` and `--pin`, for
//! the machine that talks to the same robot every day. See [`Target`].
