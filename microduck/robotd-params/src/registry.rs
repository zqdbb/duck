//! The machine-readable index of every key in `robotd.toml` — what an editor needs to know.
//!
//! [`Params`] and its `Default` impls are the truth about *values*; what they cannot carry at
//! runtime is the part a human-facing editor needs — a one-line description, what kind of value
//! a key takes, which named choices an enum offers. That is this table.
//!
//! **A table this shape usually drifts, so its completeness is a test, not a hope**:
//! [`tests::the_registry_covers_every_key_exactly`] serializes `Params::default()` and walks the
//! key tree — every leaf must appear here and nothing else may. Add a section to [`Params`] and
//! the build stays green but the test names the keys the registry is missing; the editor can
//! never silently not know about a setting. (The same trick that pins `deploy/robotd.toml` to
//! the defaults.)
//!
//! The one-line docs are deliberately *short* — the full reasoning lives in the doc comments on
//! [`Params`] and in the shipped `deploy/robotd.toml`, and an editor's footer is not the place
//! for four paragraphs on voltage adaptation.
