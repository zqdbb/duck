//! Gamepads, as a trait plus a fake.
//!
//! ## Why `configd` owns this and `padd` does not
//!
//! `padd` reads a pad and sends intents over `robotd`'s socket with **no privileged access at
//! all** — that is most of the reason it is a separate process. It exercises the same API the
//! phone app and the SDK will use, every day, so that API cannot quietly rot. Letting it configure
//! BlueZ would have undone exactly that property.
//!
//! So pairing lives here, alongside wifi, for the same reason wifi does: it is a *configuration*
//! question about the radio, it needs root, and it has to be answerable when the robot itself is
//! not working (`architecture.md` §3.1). It also comes out reachable from the phone — `btd`
//! forwards `pad.*` to this socket — which is where "pair a controller" belongs long term.
//!
//! ## What replaced what
//!
//! Before this, pairing a pad meant knowing its MAC address and running three `bluetoothctl`
//! commands in an order that is not the obvious one (`connect` before `pair`; leading with `pair`
//! returns `AuthenticationCanceled`). That order is now in one place — `crate::bluez` — with the
//! reason next to it, instead of in a provisioning script's comments and in whoever's shell
//! history.
//!
//! The trait exists for the same reason [`crate::net::Net`] does: the suite runs on a laptop with
//! no radio, and the logic worth testing is the dispatch, the authorisation and the "which of
//! these devices is a gamepad" decision — not BlueZ.
