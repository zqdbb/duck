//! Package a release the way CI does, then open the tarball and check what is inside it.
//!
//! Every other packaging test in this repository asserts that two *source files* agree —
//! `.github/workflows/*.yml` against `scripts/install.sh`, or a unit's `ExecStart` against a `cp`
//! line. Those are worth having and they are the weaker form: they describe packaging without
//! observing it, so they pass whenever the description is self-consistent, including when the
//! description is wrong. `docs/project/install-path-gap.md` option A is this file.
//!
//! Two bugs reached a board through that gap on the same afternoon. A release shipped units its
//! artifact did not contain, and then — two commits after a test was added to stop the first one
//! recurring — binaries its units tried to exec. `btd.service` failed with `203/EXEC`, which reads
//! on a board as a broken daemon rather than as an incomplete release.
//!
//! What this adds over the string-matching tests, verified by breaking each one and watching the
//! old suite stay green:
//!
//! - **a binary no unit execs.** The existing check derives its list from `ExecStart` lines, so it
//!   structurally cannot see `robotctl` — which nothing execs and `install.sh` symlinks onto the
//!   operator's `PATH`. Dropping it from the workflow's staging passes all six existing tests and
//!   yields an artifact where `/usr/local/bin/robotctl` points at nothing;
//! - **hook mode.** A `hooks/postinstall` shipped without its executable bit fails inside the
//!   update gate, unattended, on every board. Nothing else in the tree looks at a mode;
//! - **the generated hook.** `hooks/preinstall` is rendered by `package` rather than passed as an
//!   `--include`, and `every_hook_in_the_repo_is_packaged` skips `.in` templates — so no test
//!   checked that the rendered hook ships;
//! - **`package` running at all.** The `src=dest` split, the mode assignment, the version-drift
//!   guard, the `binaries` list written into `version.toml`: all of it was reachable only by
//!   cutting a release.
//!
//! What it does *not* add: a typo in an `--include` dest is already caught, because
//! `every_unit_install_sh_expects_is_packaged` matches the exact expected `=systemd/<unit>` string.
//! The overlap is deliberate — these run in 0.4s together and the failure messages point at
//! different things.
//!
//! The inputs still come from the workflow YAML, because those files *are* the production
//! packaging recipe — reproducing the list here by hand would recreate exactly the drift these
//! tests exist to catch. What is no longer taken on trust is the result.
//!
//! **Both workflows.** `dev.yml` maintains its own copy of the staging and
//! `--include` lists, and says in a comment why they must match:
//!
//! > Same contents as a real release: a dev build that omitted the units or robotd would fail its
//! > own restart step on the board and roll itself back, which is a confusing way to learn that the
//! > packaging differed.
//!
//! Nothing enforced that. Two hand-maintained parallel lists is the same drift class as a list that
//! disagrees with `install.sh`, and it matters more than it looks: every bug in
//! `install-path-gap.md` was found while installing a **dev** build onto a board, because that is
//! the artifact a branch actually ships. A test that covered only the release path would have
//! watched all four of them go past.
