//! Which calls a WebRTC peer may make.
//!
//! The sibling of `btd::route`, and deliberately structured the same way: *which service answers a
//! call and how long answering holds a connection* lives once, in [`proto::Call::destination`],
//! and this file answers only *may a peer over this transport ask it*.
//! `docs/design/remote-webrtc.md` §5 records why the two were split.
//!
//! **The match is exhaustive, and that is the point of having one per transport.** Adding a
//! variant to [`proto::Call`] fails the build here as well as in `btd`, so a new method cannot
//! reach a remote peer because nobody remembered this file. A shared table with a `_` wildcard
//! would have been the hole in both transports at once.
//!
//! ## Why this subset is wider than BLE's
//!
//! BLE's is narrow for two reasons that do not apply here: the radio is slow — a 20-byte
//! notification budget — and anyone within a few metres can talk to it. A datachannel is neither
//! slow nor limited to the room, so the calls BLE refuses *on capacity grounds* are exactly the
//! ones this transport exists to carry: intents, telemetry, the pad tap, the depth stream.
//!
//! What stays out falls into three groups, and the reasons are different in kind:
//!
//! 1. **It authorises a different transport.** The pairing PIN. A peer that can rewrite it can
//!    lock a phone out of BLE, which is the recovery path.
//! 2. **It would drop the session it was asked over.** The update mutations, and reconfiguring
//!    wifi. §8 covers what update needs before it can be permitted; it is a deferral rather than
//!    a rule.
//! 3. **It is not a client's question.** `updaterd`'s internal queries to `robotd`.
//!
//! ## What it does *not* decide
//!
//! Whether the peer is allowed to be here at all. §4: there is no authorisation on the robot —
//! a LAN peer may drive it, and a bridged peer has already authenticated to the rendezvous
//! service on both sides. This file is about which calls exist over the transport, not about who
//! is holding it.
