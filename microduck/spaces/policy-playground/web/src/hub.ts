/**
 * What the Hub offers a duck, read the way the robot reads it.
 *
 * A port of `spaces/shared/../policy-playground/catalogue.py`, which makes the same two requests
 * `updater/src/policy.rs` makes — `?search=microduck` and a `manifest.json` per hit — so the
 * gallery and `policy.search` cannot disagree about what exists.
 *
 * **In a browser, and that is a change worth stating.** The Python version ran in a data centre,
 * which is what got it rate-limited by an edge that reads `python-requests` as a bot. Here the
 * requests come from whoever is looking, with their own browser's signature and their own address.
 * The Hub is public and no token is sent: a catalogue that differed per visitor would be a
 * catalogue nobody could talk about.
 *
 * Every field below the repo is the publisher's claim, not a fact — displayed, never acted on.
 * What gets installed comes from the robot's own reading of the manifest it downloaded.
