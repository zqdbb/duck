//! The seam between the radio and everything worth testing.
//!
//! Deliberately **not a trait**. A `GattLink` trait would need an async `recv` and an async
//! `send`, and the session loop has to wait on both at once — which means either splitting the
//! link into halves with associated types, or fighting the borrow checker inside a `select!`.
//! Two channels and a plain struct express the same thing with none of that, and the test
//! constructs one by hand rather than implementing anything.
//!
//! So a backend's whole job is: accept a connection, feed inbound chunks into `inbound`, write
//! whatever appears on `outbound` back to the central, and drop the channels when the central
//! goes away. What happens between those two channels is [`crate::session`], and it never
//! learns whether a radio is involved.
