//! The robot's voice, at play time: pick a wav from the bank, feed it to `aplay`.
//!
//! Ported from the prototype's `play_voice` / `start_wheee`. The codec PCM is exclusive and
//! single-client, which two properties fall out of:
//!
//!  - **One playing child, and a new sound kills it.** That is what lets someone spam the
//!    chirp trigger cleanly — each press cuts the previous call off — and why everything
//!    that plays goes through this one struct, owned by the control loop.
//!  - **The wheee ride streams into a single `aplay`**: start → loop (repeating while held)
//!    → end, written by a paced thread so the pipe never queues more than ~250 ms — else
//!    the release would land that late. The ride has *two* exits, and they are not the
//!    same: a client that says "released" cuts it (kill the child, the writer exits on the
//!    broken pipe), while a hold that merely went stale lands it — the writer is let out of
//!    its loop and writes the end segment into a pipe that is still open. Only the second
//!    one ever plays `wheee_end_*`, which is why [`Ride`] is a state and not a bool.
//!
//!  - **The theremin is synthesized, not played.** Every other sound here is a wav the
//!    bank rendered in advance, which works because their shape is known in advance. A
//!    theremin's pitch is a hand's distance — 15 new values a second, none of them known
//!    until they arrive — so there is no file to pick. Its writer thread pulls blocks from
//!    a live [`sounds::Stream`] instead, reading the parameters the control loop last
//!    stored, and stays much closer behind playback than the ride does: a ride's 250 ms
//!    lead only delays its release, while the same lead on an instrument is the gap between
//!    moving your hand and hearing it.
//!
//! Playing is spawning: nothing here blocks the 50 Hz tick except the deliberately blocking
//! goodbye peck right before power-off, when there is no tick left to miss — and that one is
//! bounded, because a wedged PCM must not be able to hold up the power-off.
