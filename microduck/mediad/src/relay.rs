//! The robot's half of the bridge to the rendezvous service.
//!
//! A LAN client reaches `webrtcsink`'s signalling server directly and nothing here is involved.
//! This is what makes a duck reachable from *outside* its network: it connects **outward** to
//! `reachy_mini_central` holding the account token, registers as a **producer**, and the service
//! shows a client only the robots its own account owns. `docs/design/remote-access-design.md` §3
//! owns the argument; this module owns the connection.
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! **Registration and liveness** (§8, slice 2): the robot appears in the service's listing and
//! stays there, for as long as the account token on disk is the one it connected with.
//!
//! **And it carries a session** (slice 4). A remote consumer cannot reach `webrtcsink`'s
//! signalling server — it is on a loopback address behind somebody's router — so when one asks
//! the rendezvous for a session, [`bridge`] opens that socket *as the consumer on its behalf* and
//! carries envelopes between the two, rewriting the `sessionId` each hop names and reading none
//! of the payload. One session at a time; a second is refused by name.
//!
//! # A control lane that needs no candidate pair, and why there is one
//!
//! The bridge above carries a *negotiation*: SDP and ICE, so that a consumer and the robot can
//! find a path between them and speak WebRTC over it. When they cannot find one, everything built
//! on it is gone. A relay candidate is what keeps that from happening (§6) — and it is a
//! dependency rather than a guarantee: it is somebody else's service, metered per account, and
//! the control channel is SCTP over whatever pair ICE settled on, so a relay that stops being
//! available takes a JSON-RPC call of a few hundred bytes down with the video.
//!
//! So the JSON-RPC a consumer wants to send does not have to go through WebRTC at all, and the
//! rendezvous turns out to already carry it: `handle_peer_message` in their `app.py` relays
//! **every key of a `peer` envelope except `type` and `sessionId`** verbatim to the session
//! partner, without looking at `sdp` or `ice`. A `peer` message carrying an `rpc` key is therefore
//! a control call, relayed opaquely, with no change to a service the mini fleet also depends on.
//!
//! ```text
//!   consumer ──POST /send {type:peer, sessionId, rpc:{…}}──► rendezvous ──SSE──► this relay
//!            ◄─────────── SSE {type:peer, sessionId, rpc:{…}} ◄──POST /send────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! `session::run` is what answers it, unchanged: its own header says it is transport-agnostic so
//! that "a WebSocket surface could reuse it unchanged", and this is that surface. Same routing
//! table, same per-lane sockets, same refusal to parse a reply. No ICE, no DTLS, no TURN.
//!
//! **What it is not is a teleop lane.** The rendezvous allows 1200 requests per 60 s per peer, so
//! roughly twenty a second shared with the heartbeat — four calls to install and run a policy is
//! nothing, and a 50 Hz intent stream is over budget in a second. Worse, exceeding it earns a
//! `429` on the *whole peer*, which would take the robot's own lease down with it: a client could
//! knock a robot off the rendezvous by subscribing to telemetry. Hence [`Budget`], which bounds
//! notifications and never a reply — replies are one-per-request and so already bounded by
//! whatever the client itself can afford to send.
//!
//! # Why the transport is HTTP, which is not what `remote-webrtc.md` §7 assumed
//!
//! The envelopes are the gst signalling protocol's — the same messages a LAN client exchanges —
//! but they arrive over **SSE** and are sent with **`POST /send`**, with per-hop peer and session
//! ids. So the payload stays opaque and the envelope does not: this is a translator with an
//! opaque payload rather than a relay. §3.2 has the two sides side by side.
//!
//! # Three things read out of their source that shape the code below
//!
//! - **`POST /send` before `GET /events` is a 400.** The peer does not exist until the stream
//!   does — identity comes from the bearer token, and the token is bound to a peer by the
//!   `/events` connection. So the stream is opened *first* and registration follows the welcome,
//!   which happens to be the order §3.4 wanted anyway for a different reason.
//! - **The lease is refreshed by inbound `POST`, not by a healthy stream.** Thirty seconds, and a
//!   half-open TCP connection absorbs server-pushed keepalives silently for minutes — during
//!   which the robot believes it is reachable and is not. Hence [`heartbeat`-cadence] re-posts of
//!   `setPeerStatus`, and hence the split-brain poll.
//! - **Only producers carrying `meta.hardware_id` are swept.** A producer without it is never
//!   evicted, so a crashed daemon would leave a ghost in somebody's robot list forever. This
//!   always sends one — the SoC serial, or `/etc/machine-id` where there is no serial to read.
//!
//! [`heartbeat`-cadence]: Welcome::heartbeat
//!
//! # It is a task, not a daemon
//!
//! In `mediad` rather than a `relayd` for §3.5's reasons: a separate unit would need its own copy
//! of the producer identity, its own config and its own restart story, and would still be useless
//! without `mediad` running. Nothing here touches GStreamer — the boundary `pipeline.rs`'s
//! no-panic rule lives on — and nothing here is `cfg(target_os)`-gated, so the whole of it is
//! testable on a laptop against a fake service.
