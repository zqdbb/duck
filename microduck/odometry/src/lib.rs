//! Where the robot is, estimated from its own legs and IMU.
//!
//! A port of the prototype runtime's contact-based odometry, itself derived
//! from Rhoban's humanoid `model_service`. The idea: at any moment one point of
//! one sole is the robot's contact with the ground. Anchor that point to the
//! world (it is on flat ground, so its world Z is 0 and its world X/Y are
//! wherever it was when it became the anchor), orient the trunk by the IMU, and
//! the trunk's world position follows by forward kinematics. When some other
//! sole corner drops below the anchor — a step — the anchor moves there, at
//! that corner's current world X/Y, so the estimate never jumps.
//!
//! Two changes from the prototype:
//!   - The foot chains come from the `kinematics` crate's MJCF model instead of
//!     hand-transcribed segment tables — the geometry has one source of truth.
//!   - Each foot's chain is evaluated once per tick and its four corners are
//!     transformed through the result; the prototype re-walked a full leg chain
//!     per corner (9 chain evaluations per tick, now 2).
//!
//! Heading is whatever the IMU's integrated yaw says — there is no
//! magnetometer, so the world frame is "wherever the robot was looking at
//! boot", which is all a relative-motion consumer needs.
//!
//! Alpha only, like the daemon: v1/v1.5 geometry stayed in the prototype.
//!
//! The candidate contact points — the "sole corners" — are an [`AnchorSet`],
//! sampled on the sole mesh by `microduck_rl/scripts/odom_anchor_points.py`
//! (see [`anchors`]). [`Odometry::alpha`] uses [`ALPHA16`], a 4x4 grid over
//! the whole sole on the mesh: in the MuJoCo twin over a 3.2 m walk it drifted
//! 9 mm where the legacy v1.5 bbox ([`V15`]) drifted 17 mm and the flat
//! patch's four corners ([`ALPHA4`]) 16 mm, and it stands at the true height
//! (V15 sat 3.7 mm high). The scan costs about half a microsecond more.
