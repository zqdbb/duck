# Robot Daemon — Overall Architecture

Status: draft · Date: 2026-07-22 · Owner: pierre

Sequencing and milestones live in [`roadmap.md`](../project/roadmap.md).

Companion to [`updater-design.md`](updater-design.md), which covers the update
system in detail. This document covers the service split, how services talk to
each other, where state lives, and how the robot is controlled — locally, from
the app, and remotely.

Scope note: this describes where we're going for the **first shipped version**,
not the current prototype (`microduck_runtime`, which is exploratory and will be
rewritten). v1 targets a **single, well-specified hardware configuration**.

## The shape of it

Seven daemons on one board, talking over unix sockets. One of them drives the robot; three
of the others exist so that the first one can be broken without the board becoming unreachable,
and the rest are transports and sensors that own nothing.

```

**`robotd` is the only thing that touches the robot.** Fifteen servos and the IMU board
share one serial bus, and the 50 Hz control loop owns it. Clients send *intents* — "go this
fast", "look there", "stand up" — and the safety layer inside `robotd` decides what is
actually executable. Nothing else in the system can command a motor
([`robotd-design.md`](robotd-design.md)).

**Three of them survive a dead `robotd`.** `configd`, `updaterd` and `btd` have no systemd
dependency on it, no ML runtime, and no media stack, because they are the recovery path: a
robot whose control loop will not start is exactly the robot someone needs to reconfigure,
update, or roll back. That is also why config lives in `configd` and not in `robotd` (§1.1).
`mediad` and `padd` do depend on it, and are allowed to: a robot with no camera and no gamepad
is still a robot you can update.

**`btd`, `padd` and `mediad` own nothing of the robot.** They are transports. `btd` forwards a
subset of the API from BLE to whichever socket answers it; `padd` reads a gamepad and sends the
same intents an app would; `mediad` carries the same calls over a WebRTC data channel and owns only
the pipeline. All three are replaceable without touching robot behaviour, and all three are
exercised daily, so the API an app will use cannot quietly rot. `tofd` is the odd one out: it owns
one sensor, publishes frames, and reads nothing (§1).

**Releases are swapped, not patched.** A build lands as a whole directory under
`/opt/robot/daemon/releases/<version>/`; `updaterd` verifies its signature, moves the
`current` symlink, restarts the units, and then asks `robotd` whether it is healthy. If not,
it puts the old release back on its own. A crash-loop that gets past that is caught by a boot
counter ([`updater-design.md`](updater-design.md)).

| service | owns | listens on | reaches out to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `robotd` | motor control, sensing, policies, safety, `robot.health` | `/run/robotd.sock` | the Dynamixel bus |
| `configd` | wifi, robot identity and name, pairing PIN, gamepad bonding, reboot | `/run/configd.sock` | BlueZ and NetworkManager over D-Bus |
| `updaterd` | releases: verify, install, swap, health-gate, roll back | `/run/updaterd.sock` | GitHub releases, `systemctl`, `robotd` |
| `btd` | nothing — BLE transport for a subset of the API | a BLE GATT service | `robotd`, `configd`, `updaterd` — not `padd` or `tofd`, whose streams a radio this narrow cannot carry |
| `padd` | nothing — gamepad transport; serves a raw input tap | `/run/padd/pad.sock` (`pad.input` only) | `/run/robotd.sock` |
| `mediad` | the camera and audio pipeline; nothing of the robot — WebRTC transport and the remote front door (§5.2) | TCP: the console and PNG `GET /frame` on `:8080`, signalling on `:8443`; and one unix socket of its own, `/run/mediad/media.sock`, serving `media.frame` to a local recorder or perception process — and to `robotctl monitor`'s camera block, which asks for one twice a second while it is open and not at all while it is shut. A raw frame is ~1.8 MiB, so it is deliberately not carried on the WebRTC control channel | `robotd`, `configd`, `updaterd` |
| `tofd` | the head's ToF sensor: an 8×8 depth matrix it publishes and nobody else reads | `/run/tofd/tof.sock` (`tof.stream`) | the HAT's I²C bus |
| `robotctl` | nothing — the CLI, and the tool that must work on a broken robot | — | every socket above |

Where the state lives, and what survives an update:

| | |
|---|---|
| `/etc/robot/robotd.toml`, `updater.toml` | per-board configuration; the installer writes it once and never overwrites it. `robotd.toml` is read by `robotd` and — for `[media]` alone, what the camera streams — by `mediad`, so a change there restarts `mediad` rather than `robotd` |
| `/var/lib/robot/config/config.json` | robot name and pairing PIN — a file plus `flock`, owned by `configd` (§3.1) |
| NetworkManager profiles | wifi credentials; we never store them (§3) |
| `/opt/robot/daemon/releases/<ver>/` | binaries, policies and shipped defaults — replaced atomically |
| `/opt/robot/daemon/current` | the symlink that says which release is live |
| `/run/<service>/identity.json` | what each daemon is actually running, published at startup |

Everything outside `releases/<ver>/` survives both an update and a rollback. That is the
whole rule, and it is why per-board config is not shipped in the release.

How a change reaches a robot, end to end:

```text
  push a branch ──► CI builds and signs a release ──► robotctl update apply
                                                            │

                                                            ▼

                                            └─ not      ──► put the old one back
```

The rest of this document is the reasoning: the service split (§1), how services talk (§2),
who owns which state (§3), the API and its transports (§4), remote access (§5), and where
safety authority sits (§6).

## 1. Services

`systemd` is the supervisor: lifecycle, restart-on-crash, ordering, watchdog.

| Service | Owns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `robotd` | motor control, kinematics, odometry, gait policies, sensor loop, safety | RT-ish core; authoritative on anything that can hurt the robot. Odometry is a struct in the loop, not a service: its inputs are exactly the sample the loop already read |
| `mediad` | camera/mic, encode, perception, WebRTC + remote gateway | Heaviest service; also the remote API front door (§5.2) |
| `btd` | BLE GATT server | **Transport adapter only** — owns no state (§4.1). See [`app-path-design.md`](app-path-design.md) |
| `configd` | wifi, robot identity, power, gamepad pairing | Config must be reachable when `robotd` is dead (§3.1), and `btd` must own nothing (§4.1) — so it is neither's business but its own. Gamepad pairing is here rather than in `padd` because bonding a device needs root and BlueZ, and `padd` is deliberately an unprivileged client (§4.1) |
| `tofd` | the head ToF sensor: an 8×8 depth matrix on the HAT's I²C bus | Perception, so split from `robotd` for the reason below. Owns one sensor and publishes frames; reads nothing. A board with no sensor fitted runs it anyway and says so |
| `updaterd` | update engine | See `updater-design.md` |

Splitting `mediad` from `robotd` is deliberate: a media/perception crash must not
take out motor control. `tofd` is the same rule applied to a smaller sensor, and
the specifics make the case: bringing a VL53L5/8CX up uploads ~90 KB of firmware
over I²C taking seconds, the bus is shared with the audio codec, and most ducks
have no sensor fitted at all — a retry loop for that does not belong in the
process that owns the motors. Nothing in the control loop reads depth, so nothing
is lost by moving it out. It is deliberately *not* part of `mediad`: depth is a
sensor on a bus, not a media pipeline, and it is useful long before there is a
camera to annotate.

Consumers reach it the way they reach the pad's raw stream — a subscription on the
owning daemon's own socket (`tof.stream`), never through `robotd`. Reprojecting a
frame into the robot's own frame means combining it with joint state from
`robot.state` through the `kinematics` crate's head FK; `tofd` publishes the
sensor's view and does not pretend to geometry it cannot compute.

### 1.1 Invariants

1. **`btd`, `configd` and `updaterd` survive a dead `robotd`.** They are the recovery
   path; they must work in precisely the situation where something is broken. No
   systemd dependency on `robotd`, all IPC optional and timeout-bounded, minimal
   dependency surface (no ML runtime, no media stack). Detailed in
   `updater-design.md` §4.1.

   `configd` is here for a concrete reason rather than symmetry: provisioning wifi is
   exactly what someone needs when the robot is broken, so putting config in `robotd`
   would make it unreachable in the one case that matters.
2. **`robotd` is authoritative on safety.** No remote or local client can bypass
   fall detection, joint/thermal limits, or safe-pose logic. Clients send
   *intents*; `robotd` decides what is executable.
3. **`robotd`'s control loop never blocks on another service.** All cross-service
   reads are last-value-wins caches, never synchronous RPC (§2.4).
4. **Single writer per piece of state.** Every value has exactly one owning
   service; everyone else reads or subscribes.

## 2. Inter-service communication

### 2.1 Control plane vs data plane

Two kinds of traffic with different requirements. Conflating them is the classic
mistake here.

| | Control plane | Data plane |
|---|---|---|
| Content | commands, config, status, perception events | video/audio frames |
| Size/rate | tens of bytes, ≤100 Hz | ~27 MB/s for 640×480 RGB @30 fps |
| Mechanism | unix socket RPC | **never crosses a socket** |

### 2.2 Control plane: JSON-RPC 2.0 over unix sockets

- Each service owns **one unix socket**. Clients connect directly. With N=4 there
  is no case for a broker — a bus is another component that can fail, and it
  fights invariant (1).
- **Wire format: JSON-RPC 2.0, one object per line (NDJSON).** A standard
  protocol rather than a bespoke one: standard request/response correlation,
  standard error objects, and standard **notifications** — which are exactly the
  right shape for pushing progress and event streams. Framing is
  `tokio_util::codec::LinesCodec`; message types are plain `serde` structs.
- **Async with timeouts everywhere, no exceptions.** Any peer may be dead. A
  closed or silent socket is a normal, expected answer.
- Subscriptions are a stream of notifications on an open connection.

**Alternatives measured** (unique dependencies, ARM-Linux target):

| Option | Deps | Why not |
|---|---|---|
| **JSON-RPC/NDJSON + tokio** | **30** | chosen |
| `jsonrpsee-types` only (our transport) | 36 | reasonable; declined — trades frozen-spec code for a `0.x` dependency |
| `varlink` | 24 | close in spirit; less familiar, little gained over JSON-RPC |
| `zbus` (D-Bus, p2p+blocking) | 66 | see below |
| `axum` over UDS | 66 | viable; see "HTTP/WS" below |
| `tarpc` | 71 | ergonomic Rust↔Rust, but not human-readable and server-push is awkward |
| `tonic` (gRPC) | 81 | `.proto` + codegen overhead for a handful of methods |
| `jsonrpsee-server` | 112 | **cannot serve a unix socket** — HTTP/WS transports only; `jsonrpsee-ipc` was never implemented |

Dependency counts are recorded for reference, not as the deciding factor.

**Why a unix socket rather than localhost HTTP/WS.** Functionally near-identical;
the differences are in access control and failure modes:

- **Filesystem permissions are free authorization.** A socket with mode 0660 and a
  dedicated group is reachable only by allowed processes. A TCP port is reachable
  by every process and user on the box, so an auth layer would have to be built to
  get back to parity.
- **`SO_PEERCRED`** yields the caller's uid/gid/pid, used for *both* the audit log
  ("who triggered this rollback" is the first thing support asks) and **enforcement**.
  Two layers, because they answer different questions:
  - the socket's group (mode 0660) decides who may **talk** to the daemon;
  - `allow_uids`/`allow_gids` decide who may **change the robot** — mutating calls
    only. The uid the daemon runs as is always permitted (it could replace the daemon
    regardless); everyone else needs listing, and an unknown peer is denied.
  Read-only calls are deliberately ungated: support must be able to inspect a robot it
  is not authorised to change. Group membership alone saying "may replace the
  firmware" is too coarse for a device where a BLE-facing service is a client.
- **The wrong-interface bug class stops existing.** Binding `0.0.0.0` by typo, by
  config, or by a "make it work from my laptop" patch would expose *firmware
  update control* to the network. Over a unix socket that mistake is
  unrepresentable. Weighted most heavily — not today's threat model, but the
  failure mode.
- Relevant to the planned **SDK**: if third-party or user code ever runs on the
  board, a localhost port is open to it; a group-owned socket is not.

**Why not HTTP/WS as the control plane** (independent of transport — `axum` serves
UDS fine): the protocol needs server→client push for progress. Over HTTP that
means POST for calls *plus* WebSocket/SSE for notifications — two mechanisms, and
`curl` cannot consume the streaming half, so the debuggability win only covers
request/response. Doing everything over a WebSocket restores one mechanism but
adds a handshake to arrive at framed JSON and loses `curl` again. On a persistent
NDJSON connection, calls and notifications are one mechanism with no handshake:
**fewer concepts, which is the actual goal.**

**Future option, if `curl`-ability is wanted for diagnosis:** a small *read-only*
HTTP endpoint on the same unix socket (`GET /status`, `GET /log`), giving
`curl --unix-socket … http://x/status` without moving control operations onto HTTP
or duplicating the streaming path. Diagnostics and control have different
requirements; splitting them serves both.

**Why not D-Bus:** BlueZ (via `bluer`) already pulls it in, so it's on the box
regardless, and `zbus` supports bus-less peer-to-peer. But the same message types
must also travel over **BLE and WebRTC/WebSocket** (§4.1, §5.2), where plain
serde structs work and D-Bus types don't. One definition, several transports is
the goal, and JSON is what makes it free. We use D-Bus only where the OS requires
it (BlueZ, NetworkManager).

**Revisit trigger:** if `btd` ends up deeply invested in D-Bus for BlueZ anyway,
exposing the update interface over `zbus` too would be nearly free *for `btd`*
and would buy `busctl` introspection for debugging. Cheap to change — the types
stay, only framing moves.

### 2.3 Async where it waits, sync where it computes

Async (tokio) is used where a service genuinely waits: serving IPC while a long
operation runs, timing out a peer query or a subprocess, cancelling in-flight work.

CPU-bound and long-running filesystem work stays **synchronous**, and the async
caller hands it to `spawn_blocking`. In the updater that is specifically: SHA-256
over the artifact, minisign stream verification, `zstd`+`tar` extraction, and
recursive deletes of extracted trees. On a Pi these run for seconds; left on an
async worker they would stall the IPC tasks that are supposed to keep answering
`status`/`subscribe` during an update.

Genuinely fast filesystem operations — a symlink `rename`, an fsync, a small
append — are called directly. Dispatching those to a thread pool would cost more
than it saves.

### 2.4 Data plane: features, not frames

`robotd` does not need camera frames — it needs *derived features* ("ball at
(x,y)", "person detected", "loud sound"). Tens of bytes at 10–30 Hz, trivial over
a socket.

**Principle: put perception next to the sensor.** `mediad` owns the camera, runs
inference, and publishes features. Shipping frames to `robotd` so it can run its
own vision would waste most of the board's memory bandwidth.

**In the control loop:** `robotd` subscribes once and reads a locally cached
*latest* snapshot — non-blocking, last-value-wins. A stalled `mediad` then
degrades perception rather than adding jitter to motor control.

**If frames ever must cross a process boundary** (last resort): shared memory
(shm/dmabuf ring buffer) with the socket carrying only "frame N ready at offset
X". libcamera provides dmabuf, so this can be zero-copy. Prefer
features-not-frames and avoid needing this.

## 3. State ownership

Three distinct classes; see `updater-design.md` §5.7 for the update/rollback
implications.

| State | Owner | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Wifi credentials | **NetworkManager** | We never store them. `configd` drives NM over D-Bus; NM persists profiles root-only and reconnects on its own. |
| Robot identity, user prefs, tunables | **config store** (§3.1) | File + `flock` + `rename(2)`, owned by `configd` |
| Calibration, learned state, generated per-device assets | owning service | Outside release dirs; survives update *and* rollback |
| Shipped defaults, binaries, policy bundles | update system | Under `releases/<ver>/`, swapped atomically |

Letting NetworkManager own wifi credentials is less code, better security, and
one less thing to migrate.

**A board does not arrive with NetworkManager**, which this row originally assumed. Armbian's
headless image runs netplan + `systemd-networkd` + `wpa_supplicant`, and netplan is a config
*generator*: it has no scan API, and `netplan apply` reports "config applied" rather than whether
association succeeded. Those are the two things a phone provisioning a robot needs most — "show
me the networks" and "that password was wrong" — so the decision stands and
`scripts/migrate-network.sh` moves a board onto NM once. The reasoning, and what was measured on
the board, is in [`app-path-design.md`](app-path-design.md) §2.

### 3.1 Config store

A plain file plus a small shared crate — **deliberately not a service**:

- `flock` for write serialization; write-to-temp + `rename(2)` for atomicity.
- `inotify` for change notification.
- No single point of failure, readable when any service is down, and the updater
  never touches it (`updater-design.md` §5.7).

Implemented in `configd/src/store.rs`, holding the robot's name and its Bluetooth pairing PIN.
`inotify` is **not** there yet, deliberately: it earns its place when a *second* process reads the
file, and today `configd` is the only one. Watching a file you are the sole writer of is ceremony.

Config **must** be reachable when `robotd` is dead — wifi provisioning is exactly
what a client needs when things are broken — which is why it cannot live in
`robotd`.

**Config is state, not actions.** "Connect to this wifi", "restart", "apply
update", "select model" are actions, dispatched as RPC to the owning service.

## 4. The robot API

### 4.1 One definition, many transports

`btd` **owns nothing**. BLE is one front door among several. If config or
provisioning lived in `btd`, other services would depend on it and an SDK would
absurdly have to go through BLE.

```
        ┌──────── one API definition (shared crate: types + operations)
        │
   ┌────┴─────┬────────────┬──────────────┬────────────────┐
  BLE       unix socket   WebSocket     WebRTC datachannel
 (btd)      robotctl,     server-side   telepresence,
  subset    on-robot SDK  agents/LLM    full fidelity
```

Each transport is a thin adapter over the same API. BLE exposes a **subset**
(provisioning, status, update trigger/progress) — it's too slow and too
constrained for the full surface, and payloads never traverse it.

### 4.2 Cross-cutting rules

- **Per-transport authorization.** BLE implies physical presence + pairing; a
  network transport requires a token. Same API, different authz — decide where
  the check lives from the start.
- **API version handshake.** SDK and daemon versions *will* skew. One integer,
  refuse with a clear message on mismatch (same approach as `model_api`).
- **Intents, not motor writes.** See §6.

## 5. Remote access

### 5.1 Requirement

All robot and media data must be reachable over a **WebRTC** connection, to
support (a) telepresence and (b) a server-side program (e.g. an LLM) that
observes and controls the robot. The latter must be *easy*.

### 5.2 WebRTC session

One PeerConnection carries everything:

```
peer (browser / phone / server)
   ├── video track(s)   ── camera
   ├── audio track(s)   ── mic + speaker (two-way for telepresence)
   ├── datachannel "control"   reliable, ordered      → the robot API (§4)
   └── datachannel "teleop"    unreliable, unordered  → input + high-rate telemetry
```

Two data channels, mirroring §2.1: teleop input and telemetry go **unreliable**
(`maxRetransmits: 0`) because a retransmitted 80 ms-old joystick command is worse
than useless — always take the newest.

**`mediad` owns the PeerConnection.** A PC cannot be split across processes
(tracks and data channels share one DTLS/SCTP association), and it needs the
encoded media, so it lives with `mediad`, which proxies `control` messages to the
owning services over their unix sockets. `mediad` is therefore the **remote
gateway**.

The isolation cost is acceptable: a telepresence session is worthless without
media, so co-locating loses nothing a split would preserve. Local recovery stays
independent via BLE / `robotctl` (invariant 1).

### 5.3 Server-side agents: don't force them through WebRTC

For an LLM-driven controller, WebRTC is the *harder* path. An agent doesn't want a
30 fps H.264 track to decode — it wants a frame every second or two plus a state
blob. Requiring ICE/DTLS/SDP and a decode pipeline first is a poor trade.

| Consumer | Transport | Media |
|---|---|---|
| Telepresence (human) | WebRTC | tracks, low latency |
| Server-side agent / LLM | **WebSocket** | `get_frame` → JPEG on demand, or 1–2 fps push |
| On-robot SDK, `robotctl` | unix socket | snapshot API |
| App | BLE + WebRTC | as needed |

Same API behind all of them. "Run an LLM on a server that controls the robot"
becomes: open a WebSocket, poll a frame, send intents — a few dozen lines, no
media stack. That is what makes it genuinely easy.

Note also that LLM latency (hundreds of ms to seconds) means the agent is a
**high-level** controller: "go to the kitchen", "look at the person". Reactive
control stays local in `robotd`. This is the correct split regardless of
transport.

### 5.4 Infrastructure reality check

"The robot has its own wifi" is **not** the same as "reachable from the
internet". Remote WebRTC needs:

- a **signaling** path (SDP/ICE exchange),
- **STUN**, and **TURN** as a relay fallback for symmetric NAT — real
  infrastructure with real bandwidth cost.

This contradicts the "zero backend" premise of the update design. **LAN-only
telepresence avoids it entirely; internet telepresence does not.** Open question
(§9).

### 5.5 Implementation note

Library choice hinges on hardware encode: GStreamer `webrtcbin` is more pragmatic
if we want V4L2 M2M hardware H.264; `webrtc-rs` is pure Rust and lighter to
reason about but leaves us to build the pipeline. This shapes `mediad`
substantially — decide early.

Latency budget for telepresence driving: aim **<200 ms glass-to-glass**. Implies
low-latency encoder settings, no B-frames, intra-refresh rather than large
keyframes.

## 6. Safety and authority

Remote control of a walking robot over a lossy link. These are much cheaper
designed in than retrofitted.

- **Deadman / heartbeat.** If commands stop arriving or RTT spikes past a
  threshold, `robotd` stops the robot on its own. Non-negotiable: networks
  partition, LLMs stall mid-inference, laptops sleep.
- **Intents, not motor writes.** Remote clients send velocity, gaze target,
  "sit" — never raw joint commands. `robotd` remains authoritative on fall
  detection, joint/thermal limits, and safe poses. A confused agent must not be
  able to command something the robot will execute into a wall.
- **Explicit authority arbitration.** Physical controller, app, remote peer, and
  the autonomous behaviour layer all want control. Defined priority and handoff,
  not last-writer-wins. Local/physical should be able to preempt remote.
- **Session limits.** v1: one media session at a time, plus M control-only
  clients. Multi-peer video (simulcast, encode-once-send-many) is deferred.

## 7. Privacy

It is a camera and microphone in someone's home.

- **Explicit consent** to start a remote session (per-session, or a clear
  persistent opt-in the user can revoke).
- **Visible on-robot indicator** whenever streaming is active.
- DTLS-SRTP keeps media encrypted end-to-end **even through a TURN relay** —
  worth stating plainly to clients.
- BLE provisioning writes carry wifi credentials: that characteristic must be
  paired + encrypted.

## 8. Observability: logs and versions

Cross-cutting, because a robot in someone's home cannot be debugged by attaching a
debugger. What support can ask for has to already be on the robot.

Deployment specifics — the journald drop-in, install steps, verification commands — live in
[`../deploy/README.md`](../../deploy/README.md). This section is the contract every service
must satisfy.

### 8.1 Every service logs to stderr

`tracing` → stderr → journald, level via `RUST_LOG` (`info` in the shipped units). No
service writes its own log files: one mechanism, one retention policy, one place to look.

**The first line each daemon writes is its own identity**, at `warn` so it survives
`RUST_LOG=warn` on a long-running board:

```
WARN starting service="robotd" build=0.2.0 (rev a1b2c3d, built 2026-07-28T13:50:00Z)
     exe=/opt/robot/daemon/releases/0.2.0/bin/robotd pid=814
```

`exe` earns its place: it says which release directory the process was actually launched
from, which is the difference between "the update worked" and "the symlink moved but systemd
is still running the old path".

**Log volume is a retention decision, not a cosmetic one.** `robotd`'s per-tick heartbeat is
at `debug`; at `info` it logs one summary every five minutes carrying the achieved tick rate
as a percentage of target. A per-tick line at `info` would be ~86k entries a day from an idle
robot, and under a journal size cap those entries are what *evict* the logs an incident
needs. The summary also says more: a loop running at 60% of target is alive and passing its
health check, and nothing else would show it.

### 8.2 Two records, deliberately different durability

| | where | survives power loss | capped by |
|---|---|---|---|
| service logs | journald | only if configured, see `deploy/README.md` | `SystemMaxUse` |
| **update history** | `/var/lib/robot/updater/update-log.jsonl` | **yes** | 200 entries |

The update history is not in the journal on purpose. It lives in the engine's `state_dir`
under `/var/lib`, each entry is `fsync`ed on append, and rewrites are atomic
(temp + rename + parent `fsync`). So "what did this robot install, and what happened" is
answerable on a robot whose journal was volatile or wiped — which is the realistic support
case, not the ideal one.

### 8.3 The running version and the installed version are different questions

`updaterd` cannot restart itself mid-update (`updater-design.md` §4.1), so for a few seconds
after every update the running binary legitimately lags the installed release. Any tool
reporting one version number is therefore wrong for that window, and wrong in the direction
that makes a working robot look broken.

Seconds, not "until a reboot": the engine schedules its own restart and `btd`'s 5 s after it
replies, and the next `updaterd` start checks that those landed and restarts what did not
(`restart-order.md` §5).

`robotctl version` reports both and names the disagreement:

- `updaterd` behind the installed release → expected briefly, and the one skew nothing
  self-heals: the successor reports it rather than restarting itself, so if it persists the
  scheduled restart did not happen;
- `robotd` behind it → *not* expected, because it is in `on_apply`'s restart set, so the
  restart did not take effect.

Those are different diagnoses and must not share one message. `--json` gives the same
content for a support bundle, and the command works when `updaterd` is **down** — reporting
that as a line rather than exiting, because that is when someone reaches for it.

Four independent places a version is recoverable, so losing one is survivable: the startup
log line; `robotctl version` over IPC; `--version` on every binary; and `version.toml` inside
each release directory (plus `robotctl update list`, which shows the revision each installed
release was built from).

`revision` is compiled in from `DUCK_REVISION` — set by CI, absent locally, where the binary
honestly reports `rev unknown, not a CI build`. Read at compile time, never from git at
runtime: a shipped robot has no repository. It matters more than it looks: once branch
installs land (roadmap M2) several builds share a version number, and the revision is the
only thing separating them.

### 8.4 Health is one question, so it is one command

`robotctl health` reports hardware from `robotd` and software from `updaterd` in a single
answer. That is not a convenience: "what is wrong with this robot" does not divide into
hardware and software until *after* it is answered, and a robot that reverted a release an
hour ago looks exactly like a robot with unpowered servos until both halves are on screen
together. Splitting it would make the caller pick a half before knowing which one is at
fault.

It **exits non-zero when the robot is unhealthy or unreachable**, so it can gate a script —
the contract anything built on top depends on. Nothing else affects the exit code: a flat
pack, a hot motor and a pinned component are reported, not judged. A release must never be
rolled back for the state of the board it landed on.

`--json` carries the same content for a support bundle.

## 9. Open questions

1. **Internet-reachable telepresence in v1, or LAN-only?** The big one: the
   difference between no backend and operating signaling + TURN (§5.4).
2. **Is the SDK team-internal or shipped to end users?** Determines how hard the
   API-compatibility commitment is (§4.2).
3. **Authority priority** when app, remote peer, and autonomous behaviour
   disagree — even a crude fixed order, but decided rather than emergent (§6).
4. **Perception in `mediad` or its own `perceptiond`?** Bundling keeps inference
   next to the camera and is simpler; splitting means a perception crash doesn't
   kill the video stream. Depends how heavy vision gets.
5. **Behaviour/brain layer** (drives, mood, habits): part of `robotd`, or its own
   service and update channel? Its learned state is `updater-design.md` §5.7
   material either way.
6. **Bond revocation over BLE.** Nothing un-pairs a phone; `bluetoothctl untrust` is the
   manual escape. Needs an API and a rule about who may call it
   ([`app-path-design.md`](app-path-design.md) §5).
7. **Per-device provisioning state** — the per-robot pairing PIN, and nothing else now. The serial
   was the other claimant and no longer needs a slot: it is fused into the SoC and read from
   `/proc/device-tree/serial-number` (`updater-design.md` §5.6,
   [`app-path-design.md`](app-path-design.md) §8.2). The PIN cannot share the identity, which was
   the plan: the identity is published in an advertisement, so anything derived from it is public.
   A secret still has to be generated, recorded and printed at manufacture.

## 10. Build order

`updaterd` is built **first**, then used to ship every subsequent iteration of
the rest of this architecture. This front-loads update-system risk while failures
are still free (no clients, nothing valuable to break) and means the update path
is exercised hundreds of times before a robot ships.

Consequences to respect while doing it:

- `updaterd` is built against an **interface** to `robotd` (health probe,
  safe-to-restart), not an implementation — stubbed initially, which is also what
  makes it testable.
- Early health probes will be weak ("process alive"). Auto-rollback confidence
  grows as `robotd` matures; the *mechanism* is what's under test first.
- **Keep a manual recovery path (SSH / reflash) throughout early development.**
  The updater is both unproven and rapidly changing, and it ships inside the
  artifact it updates — do not make it the only way back.
- Schema fields that cannot be retrofitted (`min_supported`, `schema_version`,
  `model_api`) are in from the first release even if unused.
