//! The monitor's camera block: what the robot is looking at, in half-block pixels.
//!
//! Every other block on the frame is a number about the robot. This one is the picture the robot's
//! own perception runs on, which is the only way to answer the questions a number cannot: whether
//! the head is pointing where the joints say it is, whether the lens is smeared, whether the room
//! is far too dark for the detector to find anything in it.
//!
//! **It asks `mediad` for a frame rather than subscribing to one**, because `media.frame` is a
//! rendezvous: the capture branch copies a 1.84 MiB buffer only when a reader has asked for one,
//! and drops every other frame unread (`mediad/src/pipeline.rs` explains what that saves). So this
//! asks twice a second while the block is open, and — the part that matters — not at all while it
//! is closed. A monitor left running all day with the block shut costs the camera nothing.
//!
//! **The frame is kept as it arrived and decoded at render time.** The picture is a few hundred
//! pixels; converting 921 600 of them to fill it would be most of the work for none of the result,
//! so the sampler is pointed straight at the block's own size and the terminal's, and the raw
//! bytes stay put so a resize redraws from the frame rather than waiting for the next one.
//!
//! The mount turn **is** applied here, unlike on the raw `media.frame` path where the header names
//! the angle and the recorder turns it. A person looking at a terminal has nowhere to put a
//! rotation flag — the same reasoning `mediad`'s PNG route gives for applying it there.
