//!
//! **Twist and head are separate slots on purpose.** A single combined slot would need
//! read-modify-write to update one field, and two clients — a gamepad driving the body and

//! slots make each one single-writer in practice, so last-writer-wins means what it says.
//!
//! Every slot is stamped, because the loop's real question is never "what is the value" but
