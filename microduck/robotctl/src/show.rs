//! `robotctl update show` — one update run, in full.

//! `update log` says an update happened and how it ended. This says what it *did*: every phase
//! with the time it took, the manifest that was verified, the hook output that was collected, the
//! units that were restarted, the gate's verdict — and then the journal for the same window, so
//! the account includes the daemons the update restarted and not only `updaterd`'s side of it.
//!
//! **Times are UTC, and so is the spliced journal.** Two clocks on one screen is the way to make

//! — local time — would put a timezone database in the one crate whose dependency tree is kept
//! small on purpose, for the recovery path (see this crate's `Cargo.toml`).
