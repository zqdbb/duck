# Needs Docker and nothing else. Not run by CI, deliberately — see the bottom of this comment.
#
# **What only this can answer.** Everything else in the tree tests the engine's decisions against a
# stub `systemctl`: which units it would restart, in what order, and what it does when one is
# missing. None of it can see whether a restart *happened*, because none of it has systemd. Three
# mechanisms are therefore untested everywhere else, and all three are what a board depends on after
# every update (docs/design/restart-order.md):
#
#   1. `on_apply` really restarts the units a release ships;
#   2. the deferred `systemd-run --on-active=5s` transient timer really fires, and really replaces
#      `updaterd` — a child process could not, because it would sit in the cgroup being killed;
#   3. `hooks/postinstall` really installs, enables and starts a unit a board has never had.
#
# And one failure only systemd can produce: a unit that installs cleanly and **cannot start**. That
# is bug 1 of `install-path-gap.md`, whose symptom on a board was `not healthy within 30s:
# unreachable` — a message naming neither the unit nor the command.
#
# **Docker rather than `systemd-nspawn`.** The plan in `install-path-gap.md` said nspawn on a Linux
# box, and rejected privileged containers *in CI*. That rejection stands; this is not CI. What
# changed the choice is the plan's own argument against putting this last: a check that can only run
# on a machine nobody develops on stops being read. Docker Desktop runs a privileged arm64 container
# with systemd as pid 1 on the laptop this is written on, which nspawn cannot, and the fidelity that
# matters here — real units, real cgroups, real transient timers — is identical.
#
# **Why not in CI.** It needs `--privileged` and the host's cgroup filesystem, which is a much
# larger thing to hand a workflow than any check here is worth, and the `board` job is already the
# slowest thing in the loop. This is the one to run when `on_apply`, the deferred restarts or the
# hook change — which is rarely, and is exactly when a stub stops being evidence.
