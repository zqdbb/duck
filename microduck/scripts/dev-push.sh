# Build the daemon on this laptop and install it on a board, without CI.
#
# Usage:  scripts/dev-push.sh [--docker] [--dry-run] [--bootstrap] [user@host]
#         scripts/dev-push.sh --name duck-c51b       # find the board over Bluetooth
#         DUCK_ROBOT=duck-c51b scripts/dev-push.sh
#
# Requires the team dev secret key, and one of two build toolchains — `cargo-zigbuild` plus
# `zig`, or `--docker`. The board must be a dev board (`allow_dev_keys = true` and
# `team.dev.pub` in its trusted keys — `deploy/README.md`).
#
# **Two ways to build, same artifact.** The default cross-compiles here with `cargo zigbuild`:
# fastest, and what CI uses. `--docker` builds inside the board's own userland instead, where
# there is nothing to cross and libudev is an `apt-get install` — reach for it when the zig
# toolchain is not set up, when it breaks, or before you have a board to take libudev from.
#
# What this is for: the loop between "I changed a line" and "the robot is running it" was a
# push, a CI run and a `--ref` install. Everything CI does to make that artifact happens
# locally in well under a minute, so the only reason to involve CI is to publish something
# other people install.
#
# **It is an ordinary update.** The board applies this through `robotctl update apply`, so
# preflight, the signature, the artifact hash, compatibility, the health gate and auto-rollback
# all run exactly as they do for a release — a local build that does not come up is reverted and
# the board is back on what it was running. That is the reason `--from` exists as an option on
# `apply` rather than reusing `updaterd install --from`, which has to force the gate off and so
# refuses to touch a live release at all.
#
# **What it deliberately does not do** is anything a release does for provenance. The version
# carries a timestamp, not a tag; the artifact is signed with the dev key, which a customer
# robot refuses; nothing is published, so nobody else can install what you just ran. Cutting a
# release is still a tag and `release.yml`.
#
# The version is `<crate>-dev.local.<epoch>.g<sha7>`: a prerelease, so it sorts below the
# release it precedes and can never look like an upgrade for the fleet, and unique per *push*
# rather than per commit — the tree is expected to be dirty here, and two pushes of the same
# dirty tree must not collide into "already current".

# ── which board, and why a name beats an address ───────────────────────────────────────
#
# An address moves. A reflash, a router reboot or a different network hands the board a new
# lease, and mDNS on this image is unreliable enough that a `.local` name is not the answer
# either (`provision-board.sh` says the same). So the address is the one thing about a board
# nobody can keep in a shell profile: `DUCK_BOARD=radxa@192.168.1.42` goes stale, and the way
# that reads is a push that hangs until ssh times out.
#
# A robot's *name* does not move. `duckctl` finds it over BLE by that name and `net.status`
# answers with the address it currently has — which makes the radio the way out of exactly the
# situation the network cannot help with, and needs nothing on the LAN to be known or guessed.
#
# Cached, and re-resolved only when ssh cannot reach the cached address, because BLE discovery
# costs ten to twenty seconds and this script exists to be quick. The steady state is one ssh
# probe; the reflashed-board case pays one scan and is quick again after it.

# `Cflags` and `Requires`, and hand-writing those is not a thing to do.
#
# Two things got better rather than merely different. The sysroot comes from Debian trixie — the
# same archive the board installs from — so the versions match by construction instead of by
# having copied one file off one board. And **building no longer needs a reachable board at all**:
# the old path failed with "no libudev.so.1 on $BOARD" when the board you wanted to set up was the
# board you needed to build, which is the wrong way round.
#
# One quirk carried over from the old path, and it is inert: `libudev-sys`'s build script probes
# for `udev_hwdb_new` by linking a test binary with the *host* toolchain, which fails on a Mac and
# leaves its `hwdb` cfg off. `gilrs` calls nothing under that cfg.

# The apply reporting success means the swap happened and the health gate passed. It does not mean
# the seven daemons are running the release that was swapped in, and the gap between those two is
# where an afternoon goes: four wifi fixes were once verified as broken against a `configd` that
# had never restarted. `robotd`, `configd`, `padd`, `mediad` and `tofd` restart during the update;
# `updaterd` and `btd` restart five seconds after it replies, because the first cannot restart
# itself mid-update and the second may be carrying the reply (docs/design/restart-order.md).
#
# So this is the one check that observes the whole mechanism end to end, on real systemd, with real
# timing — and nothing else in the repository can. A container cannot: the transient timer, the
# `RuntimeDirectory=` that holds each identity, and the five-second delay are all systemd.
#
# Polled rather than slept: a fixed sleep is either a wrong answer or a slow one, and the interesting
# case is a restart that never happens, which no length of sleep improves.
