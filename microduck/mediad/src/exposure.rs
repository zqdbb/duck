//! Software auto-exposure.
//!
//! **Because the 3A engine sets the exposure once and then stops.** Rockchip's `rkaiq_3A_server`
//! does white balance, the colour matrix, gamma and noise reduction, and `scripts/setup-rkaiq.sh`
//! installs it with AE enabled. Its AE does write the sensor — measured on a robot, on a boot where
//! the engine started before `mediad` and caught the stream-start event, `mediad` wrote
//! `exposure=600 analogue_gain=1024` and the sensor was found at `1589 / 1536`, which is the
//! engine's answer for the room and not ours. What it does not do is *keep* doing it: a hand-written
//! `exposure=300 analogue_gain=256` on that same healthy boot — a much darker picture — held for 25
//! seconds with no correction. One convergence at stream start is not auto-exposure. A robot that
//! walks from a window into a corridor keeps the window's exposure.
//!
//! And when the engine misses the stream-start event — it waits for one and does not notice one that
//! already fired, which is the other half of this branch — even that one shot does not happen and
//! the picture stays at whatever `mediad` pinned. That is the "3A stopped working, a reboot sometimes
//! fixes it" shape. Fixing the ordering brings the one shot back; it does not make it a loop, which
//! is why both halves are here. With this module, exposure stops depending on the order two units
//! started in at all.
//!
//! So this is the loop, ported from the prototype (`microduck_runtime`'s `camera.rs`), where it ran
//! for months: sample luma twice a second, compare it against a setpoint, and steer the sensor with
//! a damped multiplicative step.
//!
//! Two things differ from the prototype, both because `mediad` is a better place to do this:
//!
//! * **Luma comes off the tee's raw branch**, which already exists for the duck detector and the
//!   `get_frame` surface. The prototype decoded one of its own JPEGs; here the frame is UYVY and
//!   the luma is every other byte, so a mean costs a subsampled walk and no decode.
//! * **Nothing opens the camera a second time to measure.** The prototype's first version sampled
//!   the ISP self path with a parallel `v4l2-ctl`, which contended with the capture at the driver
//!   level and killed the pipeline intermittently. Reading the frames we already have cannot.
