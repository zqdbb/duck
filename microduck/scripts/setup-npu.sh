# Install Rockchip's NPU runtime, so the duck detector can run on the board's NPU.
#
# The RK3566 has a small (0.8 TOPS) INT8 NPU. Using it needs two halves that arrive from different
# places: the **driver**, which is part of the vendor kernel and is either there or is not, and the
# **runtime** `librknnrt.so`, which is a vendor blob in no Debian suite. This installs the second and
# reports on the first.
#
#   sudo sh /tmp/setup-npu.sh
#   sudo /usr/local/sbin/robot-setup-npu          # later, to re-check
#
# Full paths, because this advice gets copy-pasted and /tmp does not survive a reboot. The first run
# leaves a copy at the second path.
#
#   --runtime TAG   which rknn-toolkit2 tag to take librknnrt.so from (default below). It has to be
#                   at least as new as the toolkit that converted the model: a runtime older than
#                   its model fails at `rknn_init` with a number and no explanation.
#   --no-enable-node  leave the device tree alone. The default is to enable the NPU node, because
#                   Armbian's rk3566-radxa-zero3.dtb ships `npu@fde40000` as `status = "disabled"`
#                   on *every* Radxa Zero 3 — so a runtime installed without it can never run
#                   anything, which is not a useful thing for this script to have done. **Takes
#                   effect on the next boot**, and this script never reboots anything. Undone by
#                   removing `npu-enable` from `overlays=` in /boot/armbianEnv.txt.
#                   `--enable-node` is still accepted, and now says out loud what already happens.
#   --help
#
# Idempotent: the runtime is only downloaded when it is missing or a different version is asked for.
#
# **Run by `hooks/preinstall` on every update**, beside `setup-gstreamer.sh` and `setup-rkaiq.sh`
# and on the same terms: never fatally, with its report in the update log. That is what the split
# between provisioning and updating is for — a board provisioned before the NPU existed is fixed by
# an ordinary update rather than by somebody remembering a command, and a release that ships a model
# should not also ship a manual step before the model can run.
#
# Running it by hand is then a retry, not the mechanism.

# replacing it, compiled by `dtc` before it is installed, with the previous /boot/armbianEnv.txt
