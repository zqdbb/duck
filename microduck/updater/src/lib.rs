//! Config-driven update engine.
//!
//! The engine is robot-agnostic; everything robot-specific lives in
//! [`config::Config`]. Adapting to another robot should mean a new config file,
//! new signing keys, and possibly a new health probe — not a fork of this crate.
//! See `docs/design/updater-design.md` §10.
//!
//! Design docs: [`updater-design.md`] for the update system, [`architecture.md`]
//! for the surrounding services.
//!
//! [`updater-design.md`]: ../../../docs/design/updater-design.md
//! [`architecture.md`]: ../../../docs/design/architecture.md
//!
//! # Deliberate non-goals
//!
//! - **No premature abstraction over the runtime.** Async (tokio) is used where
//!   the daemon genuinely waits — serving IPC while an update runs, timing out
//!   the health probe and hook subprocesses, cancelling an in-flight update.
//!   CPU-bound and fast-filesystem work ([`store`], [`verify`], [`journal`])
//!   stays synchronous and is called via `spawn_blocking`; making it async would
//!   add noise without buying anything.
//! - **No premature crate splitting.** This was one crate with two binaries until a
//!   second service needed the wire types; then — and only then — [`proto`] moved out
//!   into [`duck_ipc_proto`]. `robotd` and `robotctl` depend on that, not on this crate,
//!   so nothing on the recovery path inherits the engine's http/tar/zstd/crypto tree.
//!   `updaterd` remains this crate's only binary.
//! - **No OS/kernel updates.** Application-level only; see
//!   `updater-design.md` §11.
//! - **No hardware capability matrix.** v1 targets one hardware configuration
//!   (§5.6).
