//! The `imu_to_dxl` v2 board (LSM6DSV16X), decoded.
//!
//! One IMU, one code path. The board rides the Dynamixel bus and its 12-byte block is
//! fetched in the same `sync_read` as the servos, so there is no separate sensor to poll
//! and no fusion to run on the host — the chip's SFLP block ships a game-rotation
//! quaternion and estimates its own gyro bias.
//!
//! Block layout at address 124:
//!
//! | bytes | contents |
//! |---|---|
//! | 0..6  | gyro x/y/z, `i16` LE raw counts, ±500 dps |
//! | 6..12 | SFLP quaternion x/y/z as IEEE half-precision; `w = √(1 − x² − y² − z²)` |
//!
//! The board's full diagnostic block is 20 bytes (it also carries raw accelerometer, a
//! sample counter and status flags). The control loop consumes only the first 12 so the
//! read fits alongside the servos in one transaction.
