//! JSON-RPC 2.0 server over a unix socket, for `robotctl` and later `btd`.
//!
//! Framing is NDJSON via `tokio_util::codec::LinesCodec`; message shapes live in
//! [`crate::proto`].
//!
//! Requirements that follow from `docs/design/architecture.md` §1.1:
//!  - Serving never depends on `robotd` being alive.
//!  - A slow or vanished client must not delay an in-flight update.
//!  - An update runs to completion even if every client disconnects — the robot
//!    pulls, so BLE dropping mid-update is normal, not an abort.
//!
//! Structure: one task per connection, and the [`Engine`] behind a mutex. A long
//! operation holds that mutex, so read-only requests use `try_lock` and fall back to
//! a cached snapshot rather than blocking — that is what keeps `status`/`subscribe`
//! answerable *during* an update.
//!
//! **Access control is the socket's file mode.** Anyone who can write to it can
//! trigger an update or a rollback, so it is created `0o660`, group-owned, and every
//! mutating request is logged with the caller's uid/pid from `SO_PEERCRED`.
