# Target: 64-bit Debian userland on aarch64 — Armbian 26.2.x on the Radxa Zero 3, and
# whatever else Debian 12/13 arm64 you point it at. Needs `curl` and coreutils and
# nothing else: tar and zstd are linked into `updaterd`, so there is no package to
# install first.
#
# Idempotent. Re-running it on an installed robot re-checks everything and changes
# nothing, and it never overwrites /etc/robot/updater.toml.
#
# ── how it works ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The circularity — "an update needs the updater, which arrives in an update" — is broken
# by downloading one bare `updaterd` binary and running its `install` subcommand. That
# runs the ordinary engine: signature verification, extraction, the atomic swap, the
# journal entry. There is no bootstrap-specific install logic, so nothing here can drift
# from how every later update behaves.
#
# Notably this script never parses a manifest. It hands `updaterd` the config and lets the
# configured source resolve `latest`, because a shell script picking the version out of a
# signed JSON document would be a second, weaker reader of that document.
#
# For the same reason only two files come from the repository over raw.githubusercontent:
# the config and the public keys, both needed *before* anything can be verified. The unit
# files and the journald drop-in are taken out of the installed release instead — the same
# bytes a signature was checked against.
#
# ── chain of trust ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   1. TLS to raw.githubusercontent.com gets this script, the config and the public keys.
#   2. TLS to github.com gets the bootstrap `updaterd`. It is NOT yet verified.
#   3. That binary verifies the manifest and artifact against the keys from (1), and
#      refuses to install anything they do not sign.
#   4. Afterwards this script compares the bootstrap binary's sha256 against
#      `current/bin/updaterd`, which came out of the verified artifact. Equal digests
#      mean the binary from (2) was genuine after all. CI asserts the two are the same
#      bytes, so a mismatch is a real finding, not a packaging quirk.
#
# The residual trust is GitHub itself, which is also where this script came from — step
# (4) narrows it rather than removing it. An install that wants no such window should use
# `updaterd install --from <dir>` against files carried in by hand.

# The escape hatch for a board whose installed updaterd is too old to accept the release you
# are trying to give it. Not hypothetical: 0.1.4 taught the health gate to commit on a
# `degraded` robot, and a board on 0.1.2 rolls 0.1.4 back for reporting exactly that — it
# cannot install the version that fixes it. Every future change to health semantics or
# manifest format has the same shape.
#
# `updaterd install` refuses when a release is live, and it is right to: it forces
# `on_apply = none` and `health = none`, which on a *running* robot would silently disable
# auto-rollback. So this stops the daemons first. With nothing running there is no robot to
# mislead anyone about, which is the same position a bare board is in — and that is a path
# this script already takes. `install_units` starts them again afterwards.
#
# What is genuinely given up is auto-rollback *for this one install*: with no gate, a bad
