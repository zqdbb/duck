//! Which calls BLE may make, and which of a service's connections carries them.
//!
//! BLE exposes a **subset** of the robot API (`architecture.md` §4.1): provisioning, status,
//! and the update commands with their progress. It is too slow and too constrained for the full
//! surface, and — more to the point — a radio anybody within a few metres can talk to is not
//! the transport over which to offer "reset this robot to factory state".
//!
//! **Two questions, and only one of them is BLE's.** *Which service answers a call, and how long
//! answering holds a connection* is a property of the call, and lives in
//! [`proto::Call::destination`] where every transport reads the same answer. *Whether BLE may make
//! it* is this file. They were one table until a second transport needed the first half and none
//! of the second; `docs/design/remote-webrtc.md` §5 records the split.
//!
//! **The permission match is deliberately exhaustive.** Adding a variant to [`proto::Call`] makes
//! this file fail to compile, so a new method cannot reach the radio because someone forgot this
//! file existed. A `_ => false` wildcard would be the safe default in the moment and the wrong one
//! over time: it would silently deny new methods, and the first symptom would be a phone app that
//! cannot see a feature nobody remembered to route. Every transport needs its own such match for
//! the same reason — a shared one with a wildcard would be the hole in all of them at once.
