//! The update state machine.
//!
//! ```text
//! preflight → fetch manifest → verify sig → compatibility
//!   → download → verify hash → verify sig
//!   → extract → [pre hook] → ATOMIC SWAP → [post hook] → apply
//!   → HEALTH GATE → healthy ? commit+prune : ROLLBACK
//! ```
//!
//! Full description in `docs/design/updater-design.md` §7. Three rules shape everything
//! here:
//!
//!  - **Any failure at or after the swap rolls back.** Hook failure, health
//!    failure and timeout are all the same outcome — there is no "mostly applied".
//!  - **Nothing is extracted to a live path before signature and hash both pass.**
//!  - **The boot counter is armed before the swap**, so a crash between swap and
//!    health check is still recoverable. The reverse order would leave an
//!    unrecorded bad release live.

///
/// **`AlreadyCurrent` with stale units** owes exactly those. Nothing was installed because nothing
/// needed to be, and a daemon is still running something else — the state
/// [`crate::reconcile`] repairs at every start, except for the one unit it refuses to repair. A stale
/// `updaterd` will not restart itself from its own startup path, so the only thing that ever looks at
/// it is an operator running `apply`, who until now got `already_current`, no restart, and a robot
/// still on the old binary. Repairing it here is not the loop the startup check guards against: it
/// fires once, on a request, rather than on every start.
///
/// A rollback owes nothing, and that is not an omission: it leaves the resident `updaterd` already
/// matching `current` — it was never restarted, so it is still the binary belonging to the release
/// being returned to — and restarting there would be churn with nothing to fix.
