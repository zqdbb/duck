//! Which of the robot's daemons are running, and which release each is running.
//!
//! Started as "is `padd` running?", reported alongside the pads because a connected pad and a dead
//! `padd` is the failure that looks like working hardware: the light on the controller is on, the
//! robot ignores it, and nothing in either place says why. That argument was never specific to
//! `padd` — a dead `btd` is a robot no phone can see, with the same silence — so it answers for
//! every unit a release manages.
//!
//! Asked of systemd rather than tracked: these are started, stopped and restarted by systemd, so
//! systemd is the only thing that knows. `configd` deliberately holds no opinion — it does not start
//! them, does not restart them, and reporting is the whole of its involvement.
//!
//! ## Which release is running
//!
//! Not asked of systemd and not inferred from `/proc`: **each daemon publishes its own identity at
//! startup**, to `/run/<service>/identity.json`, and this reads it. See
//! [`duck_ipc_proto::Identity`] for why that beats inspecting a process from outside — briefly, a
//! process knows its version, its git revision and its own exe, and needs no privilege to say so.
//!
//! What is left for systemd is the question only systemd can answer: whether the unit is running.
//! The two are read together because they mean different things apart. A published identity with a
//! stopped unit cannot happen — systemd deletes the runtime directory with the unit — but a *stopped
//! unit with no identity* and a *running daemon too old to publish one* both report nothing, and the
//! unit state is what distinguishes them.
