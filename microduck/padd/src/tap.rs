//! The raw input tap: a second reader of the same pad, on a socket of its own.
//!
//! ## Why `padd` grew a socket to serve one read-only stream
//!
//! One question about a gamepad cannot be answered from anywhere else in this system. `padd` polls
//! the last known stick value and sends it at a steady 50 Hz, so a radio that has stopped
//! delivering reports still produces perfectly fresh intents: `robotd` sees a live driver, the
//! deadman never fires, and the robot keeps walking on a command nobody is still giving. Every
//! surface downstream — `robot.state`, the monitor's `requested` column, the journal — shows a
//! healthy robot, because from their side it is one.
//!
//! The evidence lives one layer below `padd`: the event stream itself, where a report that never
//! arrived leaves a hole in the cadence. So this hands that stream out unaltered rather than
//! summarising it, and lets whoever is investigating do the arithmetic.
//!
//! ## Why it reads the device a second time instead of forwarding what gilrs gives it
//!
//! `Gilrs::next_event` is not the raw stream and cannot be made into one. It applies three filters
//! by default — `axis_dpad_to_button`, `Jitter`, `deadzone` — which rewrite values, drop small
//! movements, and swallow whole events; `gilrs-core` turns `SYN_DROPPED` into an internal resync
//! flag that never reaches a consumer; and neither `SYN_REPORT` nor `MSC_SCAN` survives the trip.
//! Every one of those is a thing someone chasing an unreliable link needs to see.
//!
//! Opening the node twice costs nothing and takes nothing away: an evdev reader gets its own queue,
//! so this cannot starve gilrs of an event, and `scripts/pad-link-test.sh` has been reading the same
//! node alongside `padd` since before this existed. The node comes from gilrs itself
//! ([`gilrs::LinuxGamepadExt::devpath`]), which is the only way to be sure this is watching the pad
//! that is actually driving — one Xbox controller registers several input devices, and the first
//! one in `/proc/bus/input/devices` is a media-key keyboard that never sends anything.
//!
//! ## What it costs while nobody is watching
//!
//! Nothing. The device is not opened until a subscriber connects, and it is closed again after the
//! first report following the last one leaving — the same bargain `robotd` strikes by only
//! assembling a `robot.state` frame when someone is subscribed. A pad at rest is silent, so a
//! parked reader is not a wakeup either.
//!
//! ## The pad's IMU, when it has one
//!
//! Some pads carry an inertial unit. The "Pro Controller" Switch clones do, and the kernel's
//! `hid-nintendo` exposes it as a **second** evdev node under the same HID device, flagged
//! `INPUT_PROP_ACCELEROMETER` and named "... IMU". gilrs never opens it — an accelerometer's `ABS_X`
//! is not a stick — so `padd` drives from the other node and this tap reads the IMU beside it, on a
//! reader of its own with the same lifecycle: open while somebody subscribes, closed when nobody
//! does. It is found by walking sysfs from the node gilrs named to its HID parent and back down to a
//! sibling with the accelerometer property; a pad without one has no such sibling and nothing here
//! changes for it.
//!
//! Unlike a stick it is never silent: the clone streams several hundred samples a second whether
//! or not anyone touches it. That is why a sample is six integers rather than an event list, why it
//! has its own drop counter, and why the IMU is not opened at all unless someone is watching —
//! or unless `padd` itself is, which is the second reader below.
//!
//! ## The IMU as a control, not only a stream
//!
//! With `[pad_imu_head_control] enabled`, `padd` poses the robot's head from the pad's tilt. The attitude that
//! needs comes from the same node the tap streams, so rather than a second reader on the same
//! device this reader runs a `pad_imu::Imu` filter over every batch it reads and the main loop asks
//! for the attitude ([`Tap::attitude`]). [`Tap::imu_control`] is the main loop saying "keep the
//! IMU open for me": the node then stays open with or without a subscriber, and closes again when
//! the feature goes off. One reader, one filter, and `robotctl monitor` draws the same attitude
//! `padd` steers by.
