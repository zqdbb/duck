# Build the aarch64 sysroot that `mediad` cross-compiles against.
#
# `cargo board` links one C dependency today — libudev, for `gilrs` in `padd` — and
# The multiarch script this replaced said plainly that it "is the cost of that one exception, and
# it is worth reading before adding another". GStreamer is the second, and it is much larger: the
# `gstreamer-rs` crates are pkg-config crates, so cross-compiling them needs the *target's* headers,
# `.pc` files and shared libraries on this machine.
#
# The route CI takes for libudev — Ubuntu multiarch plus ports.ubuntu.com — is not the route here,
# for one reason worth stating: it would link against *Ubuntu's* GStreamer while the robot runs
# Debian trixie's. This unpacks the robot's own packages instead, so what the compiler sees is what
# the board has, at the same version.
#
#   sh scripts/cross-sysroot.sh            build it, then print what to export
#   sh scripts/cross-sysroot.sh --check    verify an existing one and print nothing else
#
# Runs on macOS and Linux. Needs curl, ar, tar, awk and pkg-config — no dpkg, because a `.deb` is
# an `ar` archive containing a tarball and both hosts have those.
#
# It downloads and unpacks; it never installs anything, and everything lives under one directory
# you can delete.

# The pkg-config modules `mediad` needs. `--check` verifies exactly these, so a package list that
# goes stale fails here rather than inside a build.
#
# `gstreamer-webrtc-1.0` and `gstreamer-sdp-1.0` come from plugins-bad. `mediad` drives
# `webrtcsink` mostly by setting properties and connecting signals, which is core GStreamer and
# GLib — but a data channel is a `GstWebRTCDataChannel`, so the typed bindings are wanted rather
# than reaching for untyped `glib::Object` calls.
#
# **`libudev` is here because it has to be, and the reason is worth knowing.**
# `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR` *replaces* pkg-config's search path rather than adding to it, so a sysroot
# that carries only GStreamer breaks `padd`, whose `gilrs` needs libudev — `cargo board` then fails
# in `libudev-sys`, nowhere near anything about media. Replacing is nonetheless the right choice:
# `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` is additive to the host's, and that costs exactly what you would fear —
# pkg-config answering with the *host's* library and producing a binary that cannot run on the
# robot. So this sysroot serves the whole workspace rather than one crate of it.

# The packages that satisfy those modules, and nothing more.
#
# **Explicit, not resolved.** Walking Debian `Depends` from these roots pulls 543 packages —
# `libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev` declares every optional backend's dev package, so the closure
# reaches Qt, Vulkan and OpenEXR. None of that is needed to compile against one `.pc` file.
#
# Derived by unpacking the four obvious roots and then asking `pkg-config` what was missing, one
# round at a time, mapping each answer back to a package through the archive's `Contents` index:
# libpcre2-8, libffi, orc-0.4, zlib, mount, blkid, libselinux, libsepol — eight rounds, in that
# order. Re-derive the same way if `--check` starts failing; the map is
# `Contents-arm64.gz`, whose lines are `path  section/package`.
#
# Note `libglib2.0-0t64` and not `libglib2.0-0`: trixie's 64-bit `time_t` transition renamed it.
# And `libgio-2.0-dev` rather than `libglib2.0-dev`, which is a 55 KiB metapackage — GLib's headers
# and `.pc` files moved out of it.
#
# **A `-dev` package alone is not enough for anything actually linked**, and the split is not
# obvious. A `-dev` ships `libfoo.so` as a *symlink* onto the `libfoo.so.N` that lives in the
# runtime package, so `-lfoo` on the link line needs both. That is why the GStreamer, GLib and
# udev runtime packages are here.
#
# The rest are `-dev` only, and correctly so: pcre2, ffi, orc, zlib, mount, blkid, selinux and
# sepol appear in `Requires.private`, which pkg-config needs to *resolve* but which never reaches
# the link line of a dynamically linked binary. If one of them ever does, the symptom is
# `unable to find dynamic system library` and the fix is its runtime package.
