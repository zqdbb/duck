//! Which Hugging Face account this robot belongs to — the duck's half of it.
//!
//! The flow itself is [`hf_robot_account`]: an OAuth device grant against Hugging Face, a
//! credential on disk, and a loop that renews it. It was written here and lives there now,
//! because a robot signing in to an account has nothing to do with updating one, and because
//! every other robot wants exactly the same thing.
//!
//! What stays is everything that is a fact about *this* robot rather than about the flow:
//!
//! - **[`DEFAULT_PATH`] and [`TOKEN_GROUP`]**, which are this board's filesystem and this board's
//!   user database.
//! - **The mapping onto [`proto`]**, below. The crate's types happen to serialise identically
//!   today, so `Response::ok` could be handed one directly and the wire would not change — and
//!   that is exactly the shortcut not to take. `API_VERSION` versions these structs; a field
//!   renamed in a crate we do not release must be a compile error here, not a silently different
//!   answer to a client that has been told the version did not move.
//! - **The error mapping**, in `impl From<hf_robot_account::Error> for crate::Error`, because
//!   which JSON-RPC code a refusal deserves is a question about this protocol.
//!
//! An account is what makes a robot reachable from *outside* the LAN: the relay proves the robot
//! belongs to an account, the rendezvous service shows a client only its own robots, and the pair
//! of those is the authorisation a bridged session arrives with. A duck on a LAN needs none of it.
//! `docs/design/remote-access-design.md` §2 owns that argument.
