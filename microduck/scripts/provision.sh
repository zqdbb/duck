# Provision a freshly flashed board, end to end, in as few commands as a reboot allows.
#
#   export DUCK_TOKEN=...                      # only while the repository is private
#   curl -fsSL -H "Authorization: Bearer $DUCK_TOKEN" .../provision.sh -o /tmp/provision.sh
#   sudo DUCK_TOKEN="$DUCK_TOKEN" sh /tmp/provision.sh
#
# It stages the board, reboots, and finishes on its own. `robotctl health` works when you log
# back in. Everything the second half does goes to /var/lib/robot/provision.log, because there
# is nobody watching a terminal by then — and because journald persistence is configured by the
# release this is installing, so on a first boot the journal may be RAM-only.
#
# `DUCK_NO_REBOOT=1` keeps the old four-command shape: it stops and tells you what to run.
#
# `--name Ducky` names the robot at the end — `sudo sh /tmp/provision.sh --name Ducky`. Optional:
# without it the board names itself `duck-<four hex>` from its SoC serial, which is already unique
# per board.
#
# This orchestrates `setup-board.sh`, `migrate-network.sh` and `install.sh`; it does not
# duplicate them. They stay separately runnable, and they stay separate for the reasons each
# one states — different lifetimes, different risks. What they never had is anything tying
# them together, so the operator was the glue: fetch, run, fetch, run, reboot, re-run, re-run,
# fetch, run. Nine steps of clerical work with a reboot in the middle, every one of which is
# an opportunity to do them in the wrong order or forget the second half of the wifi cutover.
#
# ## Why it always asks for a reboot
#
# Not because it always needs one, but because *deciding* would mean either re-deriving what
# the two scripts already decided or parsing their output, and both drift. A reboot on a board
# being provisioned costs thirty seconds. What it buys is worth more than that:
#
#   - Phase 2 runs against live boot config, so the motor UART exists by the time `robotd`
#     starts and a bench board's health report is about its servos rather than its overlays.
#   - Your shell after the reboot is a *new login session*, which is what makes the `robot`
#     group live without `newgrp`. See `create_group`.
#
# ## Why it takes the reboot, when the scripts it calls will not
#
# `setup-board.sh` and `migrate-network.sh` each state they never reboot on their own, and that
# is right for them: they are single-purpose, they can be run on a robot that is doing something
# else, and neither can know what the reboot would interrupt. This script knows — it is only ever
# run on a board being provisioned, where the reboot is not an interruption but the next step.
#
# What that costs is that the second half runs with nobody watching. Two guards, because the
# thing that can go wrong here is a loop rather than a failure:
#
#   1. The resume unit disables itself *before* doing any work, so there is at most one
#      automatic attempt ever. A phase 2 that dies leaves a board to look at, not a board
#      retrying forever.
#   2. `migrate-network.sh` is only re-run when NetworkManager already owns wifi — i.e. the
#      cutover took and the run is just to retire the backstop. If the backstop fired and
#      restored netplan, re-cutting over is exactly what must not happen unattended: it would
#      re-arm the backstop, fail the same way, reboot, and go round again. It says so in the log
#      and leaves wifi alone.

# For a private repository: a token with read access to contents. Carried across the reboot in
# the state file rather than asked for twice — see `save_state` for why not `~/.profile`.
#
# It is needed three times, not once, which is why it is worth carrying: fetching these scripts,
# fetching the release, and then *permanently* — `updaterd` reads `GITHUB_TOKEN` from a systemd
# drop-in on every later update check. `install.sh` writes that drop-in when it is given a token,
# so passing it through in phase 2 is what makes updates work after provisioning, not just
# during it. `finish` says where it ended up.
TOKEN="$ENV_TOKEN"

# A name for this robot, or empty to let it name itself. Set by `--name`; see `main`.
#
# Optional on purpose. Without one the robot derives `duck-7f3a` from its SoC serial, which is
# already distinguishable from every other board flashed from the same image — so this improves on
# a working default rather than supplying the only one. That is what keeps a hand-flashed board
# usable, and it is why the default is derived rather than assigned here.
#
# A flag rather than a `DUCK_*` knob, unlike everything above it. Those are environment variables
# because they are passed on — `install.sh` reads the same names, so a fork or a pinned tag is one
# decision for the whole bring-up. A name goes no further than `robotctl system set-name` at the
# end of phase 2. It is also the only thing here that is per-board rather than per-session, and an
# exported name is exactly the kind of thing that is still set when the next board is provisioned.

# Path to `team.dev.pub`, to make this a dev board. Usually somewhere under /tmp because it
# arrived by `scp`, which is why phase 1 copies it somewhere that survives the reboot.

# Passed straight through to install.sh.
FORCE_REINSTALL="$ENV_FORCE"

# Does this board need the Bluetooth workarounds? Passed to `setup-board.sh`, which is where the
# one setting they need lives.
#
# Off by default because most Radxa Zero 3W units do not need it and the workarounds have a cost:
# `Privacy = device` stops a pad forming a new bond while `btd` advertises, which is why
# `robotctl pad pair` has to pause `btd` on a board that has it. See `configure_bluetooth` in
# `setup-board.sh` for the split this exists for.
WEIRD_BLE="$ENV_WEIRD_BLE"

# Install the GStreamer stack for `mediad`? Passed to `setup-gstreamer.sh`.
#
# **On** by default, since it installed cleanly and reported correctly on a Radxa Zero 3W
# (GStreamer 1.26.2 from plain Debian trixie, `webrtcbin` registered, `/dev/mpp_service` found).
# That was the agreed trigger, and it is deliberately earlier than "when `mediad` ships": waiting
# for that would leave every board provisioned in between needing a bring-up step someone has to
# remember, which is the failure this wiring exists to avoid.
#
# `DUCK_GSTREAMER=0` turns it off — `--no-gstreamer` on `provision-board.sh`. Empty is *not* off,
# because empty is what an unset environment looks like and the default has to survive that.
#
# Unlike `WEIRD_BLE` this is not a per-board quirk: every robot wants it, which is why it is a
# default rather than a flag anybody has to know about.
GSTREAMER="${ENV_GSTREAMER:-1}"

# Install the camera's 3A engine? Passed to `setup-rkaiq.sh`.
#
# **On** by default, and paired with the GStreamer stack above: that one makes the board able to
# encode a picture, this one makes the picture worth encoding. Without it the ISP has no tuning
# and no 3A loop — green, noisy, and stuck at whatever exposure `mediad` pinned — so a board
# with the stack and not the engine has a camera nobody wants to look at.
#
# `DUCK_RKAIQ=0` turns it off — `--no-rkaiq` on `provision-board.sh`. Empty is *not* off, for
# the reason spelled out above.
RKAIQ="${ENV_RKAIQ:-1}"

# instead is the failure that is worst to debug: everything looks installed and the code under test
