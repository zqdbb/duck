//! `robotctl monitor` — the live view of the control loop.
//!
//! Two renderings of one stream, chosen by where stdout goes:
//!
//!  - **a terminal**: a frame that repaints in place, so a number that matters can be
//!    *watched* rather than reconstructed from a thousand scrolled lines. Joint tracking
//!    lives here, which is the reason this exists: fifteen measured angles beside fifteen
//!    commanded ones is unreadable as text at 10 Hz, and is obvious as fifteen bars.
//!  - **anything else** — a pipe, a file, `--json`: one line per tick, exactly as before.
//!    `robotctl monitor > log` and `| grep` must keep working, and a screen-painting CLI
//!    that writes escape codes into a log file is a CLI nobody can script.
//!
//! The stream is read on its own thread. The socket read blocks, terminal events do not
//! arrive on the socket, and a UI that can only notice a keystroke when the robot happens
//! to send a frame stops responding the moment the robot does.
