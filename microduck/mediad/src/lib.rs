//! `mediad` — camera, mic, WebRTC, and the remote gateway.
//!
//! What exists so far is the control channel, end to end but for the channel itself:
//!
//! - [`route`] — which calls a WebRTC peer may make. `remote-webrtc.md` §5.
//! - [`upstream`] — connections to the five services that own the answers, one per (service, lane).
//! - [`session`] — the pipe. Lines in, lines out, replies never parsed.
//!
//! [`session::run`] is transport-agnostic on purpose: it takes lines and gives lines, so it is
//! testable without a WebRTC peer and would serve a WebSocket surface (§11) unchanged.
//!
//! - [`config`] — `[media]` in `robotd.toml`: what the stream is, edited with `robotctl configure`.
//! - [`web`] — the console page, served by the daemon it drives. `webrtc-console.md` §1.
//! - [`producer`] — who this robot says it is, before a peer negotiates anything. §5.
//!
//! [`pipeline`] is the rest, and the only part that is not portable: `webrtcsink` with the
//! signalling server in this process, `mpph264enc` in front of it, and a `control` datachannel per
//! peer wired to [`session::run`].
