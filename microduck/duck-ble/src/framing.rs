//! Turning a GATT characteristic into a line-oriented byte pipe.
//!
//! The control plane is NDJSON — one JSON object per line — over every transport
//! (`architecture.md` §2.2). BLE is the only one where a message does not fit in a single
//! write: usable payload is `ATT_MTU - 3`, which on a phone that never renegotiates is 20
//! bytes, and on a good link is a few hundred. So a line arrives in pieces and leaves in
//! pieces.
//!
//! **There is no framing header.** The newline that already separates messages is the frame
//! delimiter, in both directions. That is safe rather than lucky: `serde_json` escapes a
//! newline inside a string as `\n`, so a raw `0x0A` never appears inside a serialised JSON
//! object — which is the same property that makes NDJSON work on the unix socket.
//!
//! Adding a length prefix would mean a second framing dialect that only BLE speaks, and
//! every client would have to implement it. A phone app can instead do exactly what
//! `robotctl` does: write bytes, read until newline.

/// Longest line we will reassemble before giving up on a peer.

/// and it is reachable by anyone in radio range. Generous next to any real request — the

/// limit, because nothing that big has any business arriving over BLE.

/// every reply over 8 KiB unreadable, which quietly took `update.show` (kilobytes for an
