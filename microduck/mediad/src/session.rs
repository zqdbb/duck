//! One peer's control channel, as a pipe to the services that own the answers.
//!
//! Transport-agnostic on purpose: this takes lines in and gives lines out, and knows nothing about
//! datachannels. That is what makes it testable without a WebRTC peer — the tests below drive it
//! over channels against fake daemons on real unix sockets — and it is also what would let a
//! WebSocket surface (`remote-webrtc.md` §11) reuse it unchanged.
//!
//! ## What it does not do
//!
//! **It never parses a reply.** Requests are read far enough to route them and no further;
//! everything a service emits is forwarded verbatim. Two things follow, and both matter:
//!
//! - A subscription works with no special case. It is a stream of notifications on an open
//!   connection, and every one has to reach the peer — which correlating replies to requests would
//!   break, keeping the first and dropping the rest.
//! - Adding a method to the API costs nothing here. `duck-ipc-proto` stays the only place a method
//!   is defined, and this file does not grow a case for it.
//!
//! **It does not authenticate.** `remote-webrtc.md` §4: there is no gate on the robot. A LAN peer
//! may drive it, and a bridged peer authenticated to the rendezvous service — on both sides —
//! before arriving. `route::permits` refuses `system.authenticate` by name rather than answering
//! it, so a client that asks gets a clear no instead of a lie.
