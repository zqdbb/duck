"""A microduck body in MuJoCo, served to the real `robotd` over TCP.

    uv run duck-body                      # one duck, a viewer
    uv run duck-body --ducks 4            # four, sharing one world and one window
    uv run duck-body --port 7801
    uv run duck-body --headless           # no window, for tests and for many ducks

Then, on the daemon side:

    robotd --sim 127.0.0.1:7801

One duck per TCP port, from `--port` upwards, and one `mj_step` for all of them — so ducks share
a floor and can bump into each other, which is the difference between a room with four robots in
it and four robots on the same screen.

Everything above `duck_control::io::RobotIo` is the code that runs on a real robot — the 50 Hz loop,
the ONNX policies, safety, fall detection, odometry, kinematics, every IPC call. This process is the
only part that knows there is no robot.

**Why this repo.** It already owns the scenes, the BAM actuator models fitted to the real XL330s and
mjlab; serving a body to a daemon is the mirror of the sim2real it does today. The daemon-side half
lives in `microduck` because it implements an in-repo trait against an in-repo protocol.

## The protocol

Newline-delimited JSON over TCP, one request and one answer per line, `protocol` checked in the
handshake — the two halves live in two repositories, so "your simulator is old" and "your daemon is
old" must not be the same symptom. `duck_control::sim` is the other end and carries the reasoning
for TCP-not-a-unix-socket and JSON-not-a-packed-struct.

## Two mappings this side owns, on purpose

**Fifteen joints out here, fourteen in the model.** The daemon indexes joints as `JOINT_NAMES`,
which includes `mouth` at index 9; no alpha policy drives it and the walking model does not have it.
The daemon must not learn that, so this inserts and drops it. Where the knowledge about a model's
own shape lives is the whole reason the protocol carries the robot's units rather than MuJoCo's.

**Gravity, not just orientation.** The policy observes projected gravity in the trunk frame. MuJoCo
gives an orientation quaternion, so this does the rotation — the same arithmetic the IMU's SFLP
filter does on the robot, on the other side of the same wire.
