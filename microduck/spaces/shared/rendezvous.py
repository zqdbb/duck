"""Which robots an account can reach, and whether each one is busy.

`GET /api/robot-status` with `Authorization: Bearer <hf token>`. Read off
`pollen-robotics/reachy_mini_central`'s `app.py` rather than guessed, because a `401` from it was
first mistaken here for something structural: the endpoint is `Depends(_resolve_hf_token)` and then
`validate_hf_token`, which is one `whoami-v2` call and **no scope check, no token-type check and no
requirement that the caller hold an event stream**. Its own docstring says what it is for — "render
a passive status indicator without consuming a session slot" — filtered to `p.username ==
username`, so an account sees its own robots and nobody else's.

Which makes it the right call for a listing, and better than the console's route for one:
`mediad/webclient/index.html` lists by opening `GET /events` and asking `list`, because a browser
that is about to start a session needs the stream anyway. Peers are keyed by token, so a second
`/events` on the same one supersedes the first (`remote-access-design.md` §3.7) — a page that
listed that way could not refresh its list without dropping the session it was holding. This one
opens nothing.

**A `429` here is not theirs.** `robot_status` is `validate_hf_token` and then a loop over the
producers — it never calls `check_rate_limit`, whose bucket is 1200 requests a minute keyed on a
hash of the token, and the only status it raises is `401`. So a 429 on this route was written by
something in front of the application, and `_who_answered` exists to say which something.

**A `401` here means the token, and nothing else.** Worth stating plainly because the first thing
that produced one was not a robot problem at all: run outside a Space, Gradio mocks its login and
hands the app the literal string `mock-oauth-token-for-local-dev`, which `whoami-v2` refuses
exactly as it should. `app.py`'s `token_of` is where that is dealt with.
