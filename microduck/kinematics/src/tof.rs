//! ToF reprojection: an 8×8 grid of distances becomes points in the trunk.
//!
//! `tofd` publishes what the sensor sees — slant ranges along fixed beams in
//! the sensor's own frame. What a consumer wants is geometry the robot can act
//! on: where each return sits in the trunk frame, with the two systematic
//! nuisances filtered the way the prototype runtime settled on:
//!
//!   - **Floor returns.** A head looking down sees the floor at every range;
//!     a beam whose slant range times its downward component reaches the
//!     sensor's height above the floor (times a safety factor, for pose error)
//!     hit the floor, not an obstacle.
//!   - **Too-close returns.** Below ~10 cm the sensor's readings stop being
//!     trustworthy — cover-glass crosstalk and pulse pile-up produce phantom
//!     short returns — so a reading in that band is discarded as noise.
//!
//! The sensor pose comes from [`HeadFk::tof_in_trunk`] per frame, and the
//! trunk's height above the floor from the MJCF itself
//! ([`Model::trunk_height_m`]) — no transcribed constants.
//!
//! This lives in `kinematics`, not the `tof` crate, on purpose: it is pure
//! geometry, and the `tof` crate carries the vendored ST C driver that clients
//! like `robotctl` must never have to link.
