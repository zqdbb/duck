//! Head-chain FK in the frames the vision stack actually speaks.

//! The model hands out MJCF site poses; the consumers — camera reprojection,
//! ToF point clouds — want cv2 camera axes (+x right, +y down, +z forward) or
//! the ToF sensor's own axes (+x forward along the optical axis, +y left,
//! +z up). The two constant quaternions here are that translation layer,
//! carried over from the prototype runtime where they were tuned against real
