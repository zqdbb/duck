# Provision a board from your own machine, in one command.
#
#   export DUCK_TOKEN=...              # only while the repository is private
#   ./scripts/provision-board.sh radxa@192.168.1.42
#
# The target is `[user@]host`, and the host can be a name or an address. An address is the
# normal case on this hardware: mDNS on the Radxa image is unreliable, so `radxa-zero3.local`
# resolves when it feels like it and a DHCP lease is the thing you can count on.
#
# The only script in this directory that runs on the *operator's* machine rather than on a
# robot. Everything it does, it does over ssh; nothing here is installed anywhere.
#
# What it is for is the seam in the middle. `provision.sh` reboots the board and finishes on
# its own, which is right, but from the outside that looks like an ssh session dying followed
# by an unknown interval and a guess about when to log back in. This waits for the board to
# come back, streams the log the unattended half writes, and ends on `robotctl health` — so
# provisioning is one command with continuous output instead of three with a gap.
#
#   --ref BRANCH      provision from a branch: its scripts run the bring-up, and its build of
#                     the daemon is installed on top of the stable release. Provisioning FAILS
#                     if that build cannot be installed or is rolled back — a dev board quietly
#                     running stable when a branch was asked for is worse than a clear stop.
#                     Needs the branch build to exist, so give CI its minute or two first.
#   --name NAME       name the robot, at the end of provisioning: `--name Ducky`. Optional —
#                     without it the board names itself `duck-<four hex>` from its SoC serial,
#                     which is already unique per board. Changeable later at any time with
#                     `robotctl system set-name`, so this saves a command rather than deciding
#                     anything permanent.
#   --forget-host-key drop this host's key from known_hosts first. Reflashing the card
#                     regenerates the board's host keys, so the same address then presents a
#                     different one and ssh refuses outright — see `probe`.
#   --local           send this clone's scripts/provision.sh instead of having the board fetch
#                     it. What makes testing an unpushed branch possible.
#   --no-dev-key      do not install the team dev key, for a board that should only take
#                     releases. The default is to send this clone's
#                     deploy/dev-key/team.dev.pub.
#   --dev-key PATH    somewhere else to find it.
#   --no-ble          do not use Bluetooth to re-find the board. See below for what that costs.
#   --pause-btd-on-pair
#                     for a Radxa Zero 3W that pairs a gamepad only while `btd` is out of the way.
#                     Leaves /var/lib/robot/weird-ble, which makes `robotctl pad pair` stop `btd`
#                     and power-cycle the adapter for the pairing window — and **does not touch
#                     `Privacy`**. This is what a board wants when a pad pairs and then flaps with
#                     `PIN or Key Missing`: that is `Privacy = device` on a board that needed only
#                     the pause. Try this before `--weird-ble`.
#   --no-gstreamer    skip the GStreamer stack `mediad` needs. Installed by default, with a
#                     report of what this board can encode. It needs no reboot, so it can also
#                     be added or re-run later:  sudo /usr/local/sbin/robot-setup-gstreamer
#   --no-rkaiq        skip the camera's 3A engine (white balance, colour, denoise; exposure is
#                     mediad's own software loop, not this).
#                     Installed by default. Without it the camera runs on raw ISP defaults:
#                     green and noisy. Re-run later with:
#                     sudo /usr/local/sbin/robot-setup-rkaiq
#   --weird-ble       for a Radxa Zero 3W whose Bluetooth cannot bond a gamepad at all, even with
#                     `btd` paused. Implies `--pause-btd-on-pair`, and additionally sets
#                     `Privacy = device`.
#                     **The default in docs/robot/install-dev.md**, because about half these
#                     boards need it and nothing measurable says which — and a board that needed
#                     it and did not get it presents as a pad that will not pair, for no visible
#                     reason. Drop it on a board proven to bond a pad without it; see that page
#                     for how to check, and `configure_bluetooth` in scripts/setup-board.sh for
#                     the measurement behind it.
#
# Needs `ssh` and `scp`, an account on the board that can `sudo`, and nothing else. It expects
# to be able to prompt for the sudo password, so it allocates a terminal for that one command.
#
# ## When the board comes back at a different address
#
# A DHCP lease moves, and the cutover in the middle of provisioning is exactly when it does: the
# board leaves on netplan's lease and comes back on NetworkManager's. From out here that is
# indistinguishable from a board that never booted at all — the address you were given simply
# stops answering, and every remaining step is addressed to it.
#
# So the wait is a race. ssh keeps polling the address you gave, and in parallel a Bluetooth probe
# asks the robot itself what address it ended up with — `net.status`, the same call the phone app
# makes. Whichever answers first wins, and an answer over Bluetooth is adopted for everything
# after it.
#
# On the same address ssh wins essentially always: `hci0` takes about seventy seconds to appear on
# this board and sshd does not, so the probe is still building when the ordinary case is already
# over. That is the point. It costs nothing in the normal case and it is the only thing that can
# answer in the abnormal one.
#
# **The probe is only trusted when exactly one robot answers to the name this board advertises**,
# which is read off the board before the reboot while ssh still works. Adopting an address means
# ssh'ing somewhere new, and doing that to a robot chosen by scan order is worse than waiting.
#
# It needs `cargo` and this clone, because `duckctl` is an example rather than an installed
# binary. Without either, the wait is exactly what it was before and says so. Three more things it
# cannot do:
#
#   - A board being provisioned for the first time has no `btd` until the install reaches it, so
#     Bluetooth cannot answer for the first few minutes.
#   - A robot with a per-robot pairing PIN needs it in `DUCK_PIN`; the probe otherwise offers the
#     factory default.
#   - `net.status` reports the *wifi* interface, so a board you reach over ethernet is not covered.
#     Which is the right interface to read — the cutover this exists for is wifi's — but it means an
#     ethernet lease that moves is still a lease nothing here can find.
