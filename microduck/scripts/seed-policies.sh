# Install the official policy set, downloading it from the Hugging Face Hub.
#
# `robotd` reads its policies from /opt/robot/policies/current, deliberately outside the release:
# a gait retrain should not need a daemon release, and a daemon fix should not re-ship six
# megabytes of unchanged weights (docs/design/policy-channel-design.md §9). This is what fills
# that directory, and it fetches rather than copies — the same arrangement `setup-board.sh` uses
# for ONNX Runtime and `setup-gstreamer.sh` for the plugins, which are the other two things a
# board needs and a release has no business carrying.
#
# Run by `hooks/postinstall` on every update and by `scripts/install.sh` on a fresh board, which
# between them are every way policies reach a robot.
#
# THE RULE THAT MATTERS: never touch a set that is not ours, and never move ours backwards. A
# set carries a `.source` record; one from another repo, or without a record, was put there by
# something else and replacing it would silently undo that on the next unrelated daemon update.
# One from our repo is moved up to the pin when it is *below* it — the daemon's defaults name
# files a newer set carries, and a board that updates the daemon but keeps an old set would
# otherwise fail to load its gait and roll the update back — and left alone otherwise.
#
# Nothing here is signed and that is deliberate: a policy is not a binary. `robotd` holds the only
# write handle to the bus behind joint clamps, a fall reflex and an intent deadman, and refuses
# any graph that is not obs[1,61] -> actions[1,14] while the robot is standing still. That gate is
# also what catches a truncated download, which is why there are no hashes pinned here to go stale
# on every retrain.
#
# Never fatal. A robot with no policy holds its pose and reports *degraded* — a board to fix, not
# a release to roll back.
#
# A board that cannot reach the Hub on a first install ends up with no policies, and that is the
# accepted shape rather than an oversight: `robotd` holds its pose and reports *degraded*, the
# update gate passes, and the next update fetches. It is the same bargain `setup-board.sh` makes
# for ONNX Runtime — the board prerequisites need a network once.
#
# Usage: seed-policies.sh [POLICY_ROOT]
# Defaults to what a robot uses; the argument exists so this can be tested off a board.

# A minimum, not a ceiling: it decides what a board installs when it has *nothing*, and the
# oldest official set this daemon runs with. A board below it is moved up to it on update; a

# **An installed set is never moved backwards, and only ours is moved at all.** The pin is a
# minimum — what a board with nothing gets, and the oldest set this daemon's defaults load —
# and not a ceiling, which is the distinction that makes `robotctl policy update` possible.
#
# This used to replace any older `seed-*` on the reasoning that a daemon update was still how a
# retrained gait reached a board. `policy update` became how, and that rule was a trap: a board
# moved forward to v2 by hand had `current -> releases/seed-v2`, and the next unrelated daemon
# update quietly put v1 back. Then it never replaced anything, and that was the opposite trap:
# when the daemon's default gait became a file only v5 carries, a board on v4 updating the
# daemon could not load its walk, reported unhealthy, and rolled the release back.
#
# So the version decides. The record beside the set says what it is; a set from our repo whose
# version is a lower number than the pin is replaced by the pin (below), and everything else is
# left alone: a newer set, a set from another repo, a set that says nothing about itself, or one
# whose version is not a plain number. A board seeded before the record existed has it
# back-filled from the directory name, because `policy check` cannot ask about a set that will
# not say where it came from — and so that this comparison can read it next time.
